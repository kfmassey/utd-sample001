=============

Susan is just trying to be helpful. Engage her then move on to Walter
As in the practice interview, I would acknowledge the comments of an overly helpful caregiver, like Susan, because the caregiver may bring up important information that may lead to a more accurate patient history and resulting diagnosis. Therefore, it would be in the best interest of the patient and physician for the physician to remain respectful by responding to the caregiver's comments in a polite manner. However, as the focus of the visit is on the patient and not the caregiver, I would make certain to redirect the conversation back to the patient based on the caregiver's comments after acknowledging the caregiver to make it clear that patient is the focus of the discussion. For example, in the practice interview, when I discovered from Susan that Walter had fallen, I expressed my concern and then asked Walter directly instead of Susan if he had gotten hurt, allowing Walter to receive my full attention while addressing Susan's concern. On another note, in the past, at my pediatrician's office, I remember that I was always asked during my teenage years whether I would like my mother to be in the room or not even though my mother came to every single doctor's appointment with me. Therefore, I was thinking if the same is possible with other family members because if a patient knows beforehand that their caregiver may be overly helpful and is given the choice to have a private conversation with their physician, then the following Walter and Susan situation may be prevented. In the case of Susan and Walter coming together as a couple, I was wondering if it would be appropriate to ask Walter if he would like Susan to remain in the room although they came to the doctor's visit together? If so, if it is not possible to ask Walter his preference alone, would it be appropriate to ask Walter his preference in front of Susan given that his answer may cause problems in his relationship with Susan? I was thinking that if the physician asks Walter for his preference alone that Walter would not have to take the blame from Susan if he prefers to speak to the doctor alone, as the physician will make the request to speak with Walter alone to Susan. How would the question best be phrased if asked in front of Susan?
Even though Susan occasionally tempted the focus of the interviewer onto her, she did provide useful information of the symptoms, and also helped with prompting Walter and provided additional information. I believe in a real life scenario, depending on the time-sensitive nature of treating the most likely causes for Walter's problems, it may be beneficial to direct the social/medicine/environmental questions to both Walter and Susan due to Walter's compromised state (his painful headache is likely distracting). However, whether or not Susan should stay for the interview is a question for Walter-"Walter, I want to ask some questions to learn more about your symptom, are you comfortable with your wife staying? " could be asked before we started. Susan's willingness to help derives from her concern of her husband, and I believe it's important to keep that in perspective. She can provide social support to Walter. Nonetheless as taught by the virtual simulation it would be best to keep questions directed to Walter. After clarifying with Walter about the details of each 7 attributes of the symptom, As Walter is enduring his intense headaches, he may not be capable to give all the relevant information. I also think in a real life interview it would be important to reassure the Walter that you are there for him; if you reassure Susan either indirectly through Walter or at least acknowledging her concern while keeping the interview in perspective (that you are there for them), I believe managing Susan will become far less of a problem.
I would probably direct more questions towards Walter. While Susan's input is helpful, I need to hear firsthand from Walter about his experience. Let Susan get her input sometimes, but overall stay focused on Walter.
Susan was a rather helpful source of information in some regards, such as when she prompted Walter in remembering some aspects of his headache episodes. She was the initial source of information about how many/often headaches plagued Walter, his fall because elf his dizziness, and his family history of migraines. Susan did complicate the matter of focusing on the actual patient, Walter, and one of her asides did mention that she felt ignored during the medical interview. Realistically speaking, it would be wise to try to incorporate her more into the conversation so that she does not feel resentful and steer the conversation away from Walter too much. It might help to ask Susan help in Walter's recovery process, such as mentioning ways in which she could help with treatment or keep track of activity. For example, she could act as his support system during recovery; this achieves both helping Walter get better and giving Susan a task to make her feel recognized as a primary caregiver. An active way to keep Susan happy without sacrificing focus on Walter would be to ask her  what she has been doing to help Walter. This line of questioning acknowledges her role as his caretaker while probing information about Walter's health simultaneously. Susan is a valuable s ounce of information after all, because she may notice changes in Walters behavior or health that he may choose to ignore.
I would agree with Simi and direct more questions towards Walter until the end and ask Susan if I missed anything
Since Walter is the patient, the questions I ask should be mostly towards him. However, there may be times when Walter does not provide enough information. In these situations, it will be very helpful to hear Susan's thoughts as well. Since I would be talking to Walter for the majority of the interview, Susan may feel that she is being ignored. To manage the situation, I would show eye-contact at times to Susan. This way Susan feels involved in the medical interview, and I am still obtaining medical information from Walter.
I wouldn't completely ignore Susan, as she is probably genuinely concerned about her husbands health, and that should not be brushed aside. However, I would direct all my questions to the patient, and if a caregiver like Susan interjected, I would allow her to speak a few times but make sure the patient is the last one heard. If someone like Susan keeps interjecting like Susan did at times, I would just tactfully ask Susan to allow me to talk to the patient so I can get a clear idea of how the patient is feeling and make a better diagnosis. In all of this, it is important to not neglect Susan's concern, but at the same time, not let it overwhelm the conversation.
The role that a caregiver plays when a medical professional is taking a patient history should depend on the status of the patient. If the patient is fully coherent and capable of answering questions by him or herself, she should be the one answering the provider�s questions. However, there will likely be cases in which the patient is not competent, and the �overly helpful caregiver� will be absolutely necessary. As one person mentioned, caregivers often go with their children to the doctors. When children are adolescents, their parents may be coming to the doctor with them although the patients are competent. In that case, it would be appropriate to ask the parent to allow the children to speak for themselves since they will soon grow up and have to take care of themselves � letting them speak to the doctor will be preparation for when the parent is not accompanying them, such as in college. In older patients, a similar method may be used to politely ask the caregiver to give the patient room to respond. However, even if an older patient is not fully competent, it is important for the provider to be able to listen to them to determine their comprehension and mental status. For example, certain questions may help diagnose a neurodegenerative condition such as Alzheimer�s. Caregivers who come with both younger and older patients should be acknowledged by the medical provider, since they take care of the patient and are familiar with their baseline. In fact, I have read articles recommending that every patient take someone with them to visit the doctor�s office � not just to fill in missing details, but also to help remember the doctor�s advice and information provided. One good strategy to deal with an �overly helpful caregiver� could be to politely ask him/her to allow for some one-on-one interaction with the patient, and then allow the caregiver to fill any details or say anything that were left out by the patient. This would allow the doctor to interview the patient without interruption and giver the caregiver the ability to have their input heard.
I think I would ask her more questions since at times she seemed to bring out some good points that Walter forgot to mention. However, I do believe that the patient's word is more important and thus he should be the one who I direct my attention to. If she kept on interjecting like she did in episode 1, I would listen to her but always confirm with the patient on what she said.
I would pay attention to someone such as Susan as she appears to be deeply concerned and a useful source of information regarding the patient. Susan was able to provide vital sources of information such as the patient's possible relation with diabetes and I would like to use her insight towards generating further related questions for the patient. Ultimately, in this situation Walter is the individual of primary concern and I would keep in mind that I must remained focused on what he has to say regarding the situation as he truly knows what he is feeling.
In a realistic situation, I personally would focus the majority of my attention to my patient instead of the caregiver due to the fact that a medical history should reflect the accounts of the patient. Although, it is also important to be cognizant about respecting the caregivers information as it could be relevant to helping the patient. Furthermore, it also establishes rapport with the patient if the medical interviewer acknowledges other family members and caregivers whom have accompanied the patient. Nevertheless, I would still acquire the medical information from the actual patient and respectfully allow the caregiver to voice his/her own questions or concerns.
I agree with Akshay. I would try to direct questions towards Walter (maybe by using his name at the beginning of a question) because Walter will be able to describe his pain and the way it is affecting his life better than Susan will be able to. However, I understand that the family is also an important part of the care team and it is important to include Susan. I agree with Akshay that using eye contact and directing answers towards both Susan and Walter may help Susan feel more included in the conversation. In addition, it is helpful to include Susan in the conversation because she may be able to remember things that Walter cannot because he is in so much pain. Susan may help the medical student get a more accurate history by including events and family illnesses that Walter cannot remember. However, Walter's concerns and comments should be heard before Susan's because he is the patient and it is important that the medical student understands exactly how he is feeling so that she can accurately convey the information to her attending physician and help Walter feel better.
I agree with Nikki, Walter is the one that came in so its important to get the most accurate history from him. Eye contact and directing answers toward both of them will make Susan feel more involved. Maybe halfway through the interview I may ask Susan one question like "Is there anything different you noticed about Walter or anything you think may be important". This way Susan will feel like she wasn't ignored.
I would agree with Shubadeep on this one. Speaking from personal experience, as a child when I would go into the doctor's office with my mother, she would often speak up for me in terms of my medical issues. Part of this was probably because she had the medical knowledge to do so, and while I understand she had nothing but the best intentions, I remember sitting in the doctor's office and wishing the doctor would just listen to me, because after all, I was the patient. I think this can apply to most cases where the caregiver is just trying to be helpful, but as a physician our jobs are to address the problems that the patient is presenting. When a relative is trying to be overly helpful, I would try to redirect the conversation to the patient, and if still, the caregiver does not get the hint, I would try to find a situation where I could get the patient alone (perhaps talk to them after the caregiver has left the room or even go as far as to ask the caregiver to leave the room so I can talk directly to the patient). It's our jobs as physicians to make the patient comfortable and not experience white-coat syndrome, and if they're not able to communicate to us efficiently because of a family member or spouse, the connection and rapport might be compromised. Therefore, as a physician, I think it is best to focus on the problems of the patient and use the information that the caregiver is providing as supplementary to the patient's complaints. That being said, if a patient seems inclined to either lying about habits or not providing any information at all, it might be a good idea to weigh the caregiver's opinions more heavily.
In a real-life medical interview, I would use some of the information that I feel is important from Susan as a way to transfer the attention back to the patient. For example, in the simulation, Susan talked about Walter's family history of migraines. I used the opportunity to find out a little about the family's history of migraines, then I was able to transfer the attention to Walter regarding the information. The caregiver is usually pretty helpful in terms of information, but the patient, if an adult, is the best source of interaction for their medical interview.
It is important to make sure they are a part of the support group at home if ongoing care is needed. In order to do this, I would need to either find a way to encourage the patient to speak for themselves rather than allow the caregiver to do all the talking. One way I might do this is to point out that there are things that the patient might be the only person with knowledge of it. I would encourage the patient to discuss all information brought up by the "Susan" and use the information she provides, but encourage her to allow the patient to speak for himself while she might provide talking points if the patient forgets to mention symptoms that the caregiver noticed. Her concern for the patient is quite evident and it would be rude and she would get very offended if nobody paid attention to her concerns. Obviously if the patient, Walter, was unable to describe his own situation and had a reason that Susan needed to speak on his behalf the situation would be different. At the end of the history I feel as though it would be appropriate to ask Susan if she had any other concerns which would make her feel included but also not make the patient feel like Susan was in control of his health care. I feel as though it is always important to keep the patient involved with their own treatment.
I agree with both of the previous comments. No matter where one works there will always be overbearing family members who want to contribute their opinion on the situation. It is always important to remember that the caregiver although overly helpful is merely concerned for the patient, therefore empathy and sincerity must be shown to them. However, when presented with an overly helpful caregiver the key is to stay focused on the patient and make sure they feel that there input is the most valuable. One must ensure they direct their questions to the patient and not the caregiver. If the caregiver provides information it is important to check this information with the patient and ask their opinion. Their opinion could contain a different outlook on the situation or possibly different information about how they felt that contradicts what the caregiver interpreted themselves. In this simulation and when we watched the simulation on Change Talk, both physicians demonstrated the ability to listen respectfully to what the caregiver had to say and then ask the patients opinion on this matter. This is incredibly important, because an overly helpful caregiver can sometimes overshadow the patient and cause them to not share information or possibly agree with the information that is not entirely correct. A physician must constantly be aware if the caregiver is overbearing to redirect the conversation towards the patient, even if the patient seems to be silent or without an opinion (as Walter occasionally did). In the event that the caregiver is too overbearing to the point where the patient cannot speak it may be necessary to ask them respectfully to step out while you ask the patient a few more questions in private. I remember when I was at the doctor at age 16, and they had all parents of teenagers step outside for part of the patient interview to ensure that I, the patient, or any other adolescent could add any information and give their unbiased feelings. I have viewed patients in the ER express more information without a caregiver there because they do not worry so much that the information they provide will illicit a response from the caregiver. People also open up when they do not feel judged. I believe especially with adolescents and married adults this is important, because it establishes a relationship between the doctor and the patient where information is not impeded by an overly helpful caregiver. Overall, a doctor must focus their information on the patient and not allow a caregiver to impede receiving facts from the patient on how they feel. If the caregiver is impeding the conversation even after the doctor continually redirects it, the doctor should politely ask the caregiver to step out while he or she asks a couple more questions in private.
I agree with everything that has been said so far. To add on to everything that has been said so far, I think another thing that is important to remember is that as medical professionals, we are trained to try and gather as much information as possible while taking a history. Sometimes, it is possible that in this pursuit of information, we forget to keep certain important factors in mind. These factors, such as active listening and engaging the patient, can provide us with even more information than just taking a very focused history can. In this case, an over-protective caregiver such as Susan can both help and hinder the interview process. There are two specific points during the interview that make this very clear. The first point was when Walter was speaking about his headache and Susan was giving her input as well. During this part of the conversation, it was evident that Walter was having some discomfort with his arm. This detail may have been easily missed if the medical professional was focusing on what Susan was saying rather than paying attention to Walter. This observation led to the discovery that Walter experiences a weak and tingling feeling in his left arm along with the headaches. In this case, it portrays the possible detriments in talking to the caregiver more than the patient. However, there was another situation present in the interview where Susan did, in fact, help to get more information. The medical professional asked Susan whether she had noticed anything else out of the ordinary about Walter, which led to the discovery that he has been more tired than usual and that he has been feeling very dizzy. The important thing to learn from this is that as medical professionals, it is our job to know when to engage the caregiver in the conversation and when to try and focus mainly on the patient. Sometimes, the caregiver can have insight as to the patient�s behavior that he or she may not have noticed and it is important to hear their opinion. However, it is equally important to know when to shift the attention back to the patient to make it seem as if they are involved in the conversation and not make them feel as if they are being ignored while people discuss their health issues around them. Overall, the ideas of practicing active listening and developing a rapport with the patient are things that we, as medical professionals, have to make a conscious effort to practice every time that we see a patient.
It was evident that throughout the interview, Susan was very eager to input and contribute to the conversation. Many times she was able to lead the interview in a productive manner. However, as a physcian, it is important to focus on Walter and gather as much information as possible from him because he is the one that can best describe the feelings/symptoms that he experiences. The best way to do this is to initially make Susan aware of the importance of Walters comments and that at the end you will ask for her thoughts on what she's noticed in Walters recent behavior or any other important medical information. Many times a patient can be  unaware or in-denial of symptoms that they experience. By having Susan,the physician can pick up on things that Walter may have failed to mention or things that he may have not noticed. For example, the physician may not have gather Walter's family history concerning low blood sugar had Susan not provided her input. Having Susan is helpful, however it is the 1 on 1 interaction with Walter that is a primary concern.
I agree with all the listed points. Because she was able to bring up important information, including her in the conversation is beneficial if we would like to get as much information as possible. At the same time, a healthcare member must know when to divert the conversation toward Walter. As Mustafa said, asking her if there was anything important she wanted to add than what was already said would allow us to gain additional information that could be useful. Even if it seems irrelevant to Walter t bring it up, it could be important in making a diagnosis.
Though the information from a caregiver is an important supplement to information, the main focus of an interview should remain on the patient. In some cases, e.g. ones in which a patient has some form of dementia, the information from a caregiver is very much depended on. How much information a practitioner should absorb from a caregiver is ultimately a case-by-case decision made with the best judgement of the practitioner and his/her impressions of the accuracy of information. If the extra help from the caregiver ever becomes overwhelmingly obstructive to the medical interview, I would most likely kindly ask the caregiver to leave the room. My decision to manage a caregiver is ultimately a case-by-case decision and whatever happens I will make the decision with the best intentions to obtain the most accurate information from my pateint.
Although an overly helpful caregiver like Susan can seem burdensome while trying to talk to a patient, they can provide some useful information and possibly bring things up that the patient didn't, like Susan did with Walter fainting. While still acknowledging Susan and her role in the caregiving process, I would direct the majority of the conversation and questions towards the patient, Walter. An overly helpful caregiver can be an asset to a physician, but it is important to make sure that the interview stays focused on the thoughts and answers from the patient, not the caregiver.
During the opening statements I already noted that Susan might pose a problem later on. And lo and behold, she interrupted multiple times during the rest of the interview! Just like in a real encounter, it was with good intention. But while the physician (or medical student) is taking a history--or even during any other physician-patient interaction--there should be minimal disturbance to allow the physician-patient relationship to develop. This way the physician can take an accurate history. To be fair I did not think Susan was all bad. Friends, family members, and other caretakers of the patient can sometimes provide information during the history that is of clinical use. However I think that this information should be always be taken as a secondary source of information. The patient's thoughts and feelings on his health status should be taken into account before paying heed to any other source. Additionally, other sources, even if its an overly-helpful caregiver like Susan, may prompt or remind the patient about something they wished to say but had forgotten. In this case they prove very useful, as Susan did a few times during the interview. Overall, the physician has to maintain a kind of social/clinical balance when a patient is accompanied in the room. HE or she must place the patients wishes and opinions first and foremost and always prioritize the patient, while passively listening to the other member in the room. Of course, there is also always the option of asking the other member to leave the room, or asking to patient to schedule another visit alone, in order to correctly fulfill the needs of the patient.
The best way to manage a caregiver like Susan is to find a balance in the conversation between eliciting pertinent information from the patient and the caregiver. Susan was able to fill in the blanks whenever the patient was unsure about certain symptoms and conditions. It is important to make sure that the patient's responses are taken into consideration because they are the one who is ultimately receiving the care/treatment.
In response to the below comments, while I do understand that ideally the interview should primarily take place between the patient and the physician/medical student, in this case I feel that Susan was not just helpful, but rather essential. I know that ideally, it would be important to build the patient-physician relationship properly and that the patient's information is the most important (Neel's comment below), but in this case, it seemed like Walter did not even feel his symptoms were that bad.  I kept getting the feeling from him that he felt his headache wasn't a big deal and that he didn't really feel something major was going on. He didn't even seem to intend to tell the medical student that he had fainted, for example, and he hadn't even noticed his arm was tingling.  I feel like in a situation like this where the patient is underplaying his symptoms, an overly helpful caregiver like Susan should definitely be listened to. I feel like this could also apply to situations with motivational interviewing, where the patient may not feel they have a problem (for example, obese patients, patients that smoke and/or are alcoholics). The caregiver may be concerned about their loved one's drinking/diet/smoking behaviors but the patient themselves may not care, and therefore may not give substantial or completely accurate information.
In the interview, Susan clearly cared about Walter and was a good source of information. She provided insight into Walter's family history, his associated symptoms, and his previous experiences with the headache. In this case, I think that her contributions were valuable in increasing Walter's quality of care. Additionally, creating rapport (through good conversation?) with both the patient and the caregiver can increase compliance later on. However, during the interview it is important to focus on the primary source of info: the patient. In a real-life medical interview, I would utilize Susan's input to better interview Walter. Directing questions toward the patient would make sure that I have the correct information and help focus the conversation more on Walter.
Although the caregiver is an important individual and attention should be given to him or her, I would attempt to focus the majority of my attention on the patient so that patient can provide the first hand information needed and can give the exact answers. Perhaps, one method of dealing with an overly helpful caregiver could be by giving them a preset time to discuss with the nurse regarding the person of interest and the information can be present in the notes for the physician to review and to determine if relevant enough for follow up questioning.
Courtney makes a great point-your ultimate goal is to devise the best care for the patient, and therefore, the module wanted us to almost completely ignore the patient's wife, Susan. However, in this simulation, there were many times the patient could not remember details or was unsure, and in those moments it was important to take Susan's input into consideration (although the patient's word was more important).
It is helpful for the physician when the caregiver of the patient provides relevant, detailed information about the patient when the patient is unable to. However, if the patient is willing and able to discuss the chief complaint, an overly helpful caregiver should try to avoid interrupting the physician patient communication flow. The physician should direct questions to the patient to learn more information. When providing information, the physician can address advice and concerns to the patient and the caregiver. (This will acknowledge the caregiver and respect the caregiver�s wishes of wanting to be involved in helping the patient). In this way, the caregiver can be mobilized to actively listen and help the patient. At the same time, the caregiver sometimes notices things about the patient that the patient himself cannot. For this reason, it is important to hear the caregiver�s concerns. Especially when the patient is very young or old, caregivers can provide their valuable perspective.
I would respectfully listen to the caregiver, and then steer the conversation back to the patient. You are there to see the patient, and their input is the most useful in taking the medical history.
I would address the patient by name when asking questions to ensure I get answers from him because his input is the most important. I would direct some questions to the caregiver to not upset her, and she may offer some valuable information.
I would just continue to direct my questions to Walter and make sure to make it obvious that I'd like for Walter to tell me about his headache in his perspective.
While listening to Susan's input and taking it into account, I would also make sure that Walter is getting a chance to talk about his problem as well. Walter, the patient, is the most knowledgeable about his headaches, so it is important that I get as much first-hand information from him as possible. Susan might also have valuable input on his behavior as well, but that information is secondary to Walter's.
I prefer to hear information from the patient. Although Susan's input is helpful at times, it doesn't tell me how Walter himself is feeling. He is the person with the complaint, and therefore he knows more about them. Susan's information is more secondary rather than primary, prevalent information, but it was helpful to hear about Walter's dizziness from her.
Although some relevant information can be gleaned from the caregiver, the caregiver themselves is not experiencing the patient's symptoms. Therefore, I would direct my questions directly to the patient by using their name before I ask a question. This way, the patient will answer the question, and not the caregiver. Additionally, I would continue to maintain most of my eye contact with the patient and direct my stance and posture towards the patient rather than the caregiver themselves.
I would manage an overly helpful caregiver by actively listening to what the caregiver has to say, making sure that the caregiver knows I heard what they said, and then directing my next questions towards the patient. Listening to the caregiver can be insightful to the social history and home life of the patient, but the patient is the only person experiencing the symptoms firsthand.
I would pay attention to what the caregiver has to say with the proper respect and interest, but return to the patient for further explanation or follow-up question regarding what the caregiver was speaking about. If this kind of extra information is unnecessary, I would continue my interview of the patient, focusing on his/her chief complaint.
I would allow the caregiver say what she wants to tell me, but direct my questions at the patient to verify what the caregiver says.  I would also maintain contact with the patient and significantly less often with the caregiver to nonverbally communicate that the patient is the one I'm more interested in talking to.
I would be sure to acknowledge the presence and remarks of the caregiver and put her at ease, but focus on the most important aspect of the medical interview: the patient. At times, it may be useful to include the caretaker when trying to receive more details about a certain condition, but most initial questions should be directed to the patient.
In order to ensure Susan understands her information is appreciated but secondary to that of Walter's, I would convey positive body language as she speaks and then address medically relevant points she brings up to Walter. If she continues to go on tangents and prevents the flow of the interview, I would respectfully tell her I would like to know more about how Walter feels about his situation, qualifying such a statement with an affirmation of her importance in Walter's care and recovery.
An interviewer's goal is to acquire as much pertinent information directly from the patient as possible, and while a caregiver is certainly helpful in providing a supplemental narrative that can qualify vague answers, a remark to Susan that she is helpful in jogging Walter's memory would indicate what role she could play appropriately in the context of the interview.  Regardless, Susan is so responsive that I would certainly welcome her comments but make it clear that I was guiding any knowledge towards fueling my conversation with Walter through my body language and pointed questioning at Walter - this allows both of them to be involved, but keeps Walter as the focus.
I would allow the caregiver to give her input on the health of the patient in order to gather more information from a different perspective. However, I would ultimately direct my questions towards the patient so that he feels that his needs are being addressed properly and so that he is informed about the circumstances of his health.
In an interview, it is important to remember that the patient knows and understands his/her condition the best.Thus, the interviewer should acknowledge the caregiver for their comments and thank them. However, questions and comments about the patient's pain should be directed at the patient. Also, many times, an overly helpful caregiver can influence the patient's answers. At this point, I would direct all questions only to the patient and address the concerns that he/she voices. With Walter's scenario, I focused solely on Walter's concerns and comments. I would expand more on his thoughts, and, although, Susan's comments were helpful, I did not question her about them. This ensured Walter that he had my undivided attention and that his concerns were being attended to.
I would try to steer the discussion towards the patient by asking focused questions that centralize the patient's ailments. Although I would acknowledge a caregiver's input, body language and questions would be directed in a way that places focus on the patient.
I would take into regard the comments of the caregiver but I would address the patient directly for the most part, asking him the questions and getting more details from him. Although the caregiver surely has valuable information and is useful in reminding Walter to mention important facts, Walter's personal opinions, feelings, and comments are probably the most relevant.
I would listen to the caregiver to show her respect but ultimately take what I believe to be relevant information and use that as I directly address the patient
I would let the caregiver tell me about her concerns, but I would devote most of my attention to the patient directly. While I would take into consideration what Susan told me, but I will mostly focus on Walter's concerns. Although she might provide some useful information, Walter is the main focus as he is the patient, so his concerns and feelings are more important.
The most valuable information lies with the actual patient, so directing the questions towards him/her would subtlety indicate to the caregiver to let him/her speak. Positioning my body more towards the patient would also facilitate this purpose.
Caregivers represent an important aspect of a patient's medical care, and can provide helpful information to a physician. However, it is important for patients to feel comfortable enough with the physician in order to trust them and provide information themselves. I think that the best way to manage an overly helpful caregiver is to underscore that any questions that either they or the patient have will be answered at the end of the interview. In this way, caregivers can understand that they will not be completely shut out of the interview process if they feel that they have information that the physician should know. Furthermore, this can help the patient feel more comfortable without having to worry about being interrupted while providing medical information.
I would listen to the caregiver voice her opinions and her concerns and take them into account. However, I would focus more on my own patient and his/her description of what happened. It is important to listen to the patient first and the caregiver second.
As everyone else has said, a helpful caregiver like Susan should not be ignored but the focus should be on the patient. It's best to get the history from the patient and Susan's knowledge can be used as supporting information. It's also nice to have another point of view where she might reveal something that would not have been discussed. I would let the patient speak and then ask Susan directly if she has something to add.
I agree with the sentiment that the main focus should be on the patient during medical interviews.  However, at times, caregivers can be excellent sources of useful information.  For example, without the wife's input during Episode 1, we would have never found out about the patient's previous fall due to dizziness (stroke sign).  If possible, I think that the caregiver should be asked to provide input where necessary, and the accuracy of the statements should be confirmed by the patient.  It is important that the patient does not feel ignored throughout this process.  If the caregiver is being overly helpful and the physician senses that the patient feels neglected, it would be possible to politely ask the caregiver to leave the room while you ask the patient some questions.
Listen and take into account what Susan has to say as it may be important or useful information. Then, focus on what Walter says while keeping the relevant information in mind

I think a good way to get more information is by guiding the patient to elaborate. If the patient responds to an open-ended question with a vague answer, using a more direct question to fill in specific information that has not yet been offered may be helpful. For example, if the patient vaguely tells you about a specific symptom, you could ask them to elaborate by asking them about the seven attributes of a symptom.  Asking questions like "what then?" or "what happened next?" may get more specific information as well.
Prod further and ask for more information in details. "Can you describe that more for me, please?" Basically lead them to opening up more and perhaps providing them with good adjectives to help them describe what they're experiencing. Ex: "Is the pain throbbing, stabbing, aching, radiating, sharp, or dull?"
When a patient gives a vague answer, I generally feel that they are giving an overview, or summarizing answer to an open-ended question. A good way to follow up the open-ended question would be to perhaps ask the patient to elaborate. However, the use of silence can also be beneficial, especially when it is obvious through non-verbal gestures that the patient is not completely finished with their train of thought. Personally, when I give a vague answer to a question, most of the time it is because I'm still not done thinking about the answer and just want to give a bit of prior information.
A vague answer from a patient may be the natural response to an open-ended question. The patient may feel that the question is too broad and not know how to frame their answer, or may not be able to formulate in words how they are feeling. For example, the question regarding Walter's type of headache pain was not making much headway until the interviewer gave several examples of pain types when asking if the headache was similar to throbbing or sharp pain among others, to which Walter responded with sharp pains. Giving patients choices too soon runs the risk of leading the patient, which may reduce the amount of detail and truth in medical histories, so it is important to incorporate strategies such as silence. As Zhong mentioned in his earlier discussion post, silence on the part of the healthcare provider is beneficial because it allows the patient to collect their thoughts without the pressure of keeping up with the interviewer's questions. Letting the patient have a few seconds to figure out how to word their opinions is a good way to understand what is going on, leading to more accurate histories.
Ask more open ended questions pertaining to the first question at hand. Ask them to elaborate or expand on their response to really clarify. If that still does not work, then try some closed questions.
I would ask the patient to explain further what they mean. Sometimes the patient doesn't know exactly how to explain the condition he/she is experiencing. Closed questions can help the patient describe the condition, thereby obtaining specific information.
The gold standard in taking a patient history is beginning with open-ended questions to allow the patient to discuss what they are feeling. Overall, these questions leave room for the patient to tell the physician in their own words information about their chief complaint. For example, saying, "tell me more about the pain you are feeling today" was an open-ended question in episode one. However, when patients are giving vague answers to open-ended questions, these types of questions lose their power to elicit information. In the case of this happening a doctor can use leading questions or clarifying questions. These can be used in addition to open-ended question, but can be more affected by the physician�s opinion of what is wrong. For example, if a patient has said they have pain a doctor can respond by asking more explicit questions to elicit more information, but this can also lead the patient down a more definitive path. Often this method is used when asking about associated symptoms. After the physician asks if there are any other symptoms they can reiterate the questions by saying, "Ok, so no nausea, vomiting, flu like symptoms." This is to ensure the patient has considered all the options, especially the ones the doctor may think would accompany a diagnosis they are considering. The second option is using clarifying questions, which are used to clarify the vague information the patient has already presented. When the patient states in episode one that his head hurts a lot, he initially does not give a great deal of information. This is where clarifying questions can help to gain more information about the characteristics of the patient�s complaint. For example, a doctor may follow the open-ended question "Tell me about the pain" with a clarifying question of "Does the pain wax or wane during any activities." Overall, both clarifying and leading questions are similar and attempt to coax more specific information from previously vague answers. Lastly, in addition to using different forms of questions, using the technique of silence may encourage patients to share more information to fill the void. Often if a physician stays quiet and waits for more information patients will provide more, so they do not have to sit in silence. Overall, these techniques can be used when taking a patient history to gain more information about a patient�s chief complaint.
If the patient gives vague answers, maybe start asking a few specific, close-ended questions to give the patient an idea of the level of detail you are looking for in your answers. Then, go back to open-ended questions to allow the patient to express him/herself fully again. If the patient still gives vague answers, you as a doctor can always tailor the scope and specificity of your questions to get the information you are seeking.
I agree that open ended questions should be used to get more specific answers. However, if the patient is still not able to provide an accurate answer I think it is acceptable to give the patient a list of options and allow the patient to choose from those options. For example, in the video the student asks if Walter has a throbbing, squeezing, or sharp pain and based on these options Walter was better able to describe what he was feeling. Also, pausing for a few seconds after a patient gives a vague answer may give the patient time to think more about the question and clarify the answer by themselves.
Vague answers can be dealt with by repeating the phrase back to the patient in a question, as seen in the video. It may be a sign that the patient is uncomfortable about the topic or doesn't feel the need to elaborate on that symptom, or due to a reserved personality. Patients can also become more tired as the exam progresses, resulting in shorter/ vague answers. If you have a good understanding of the patient's body language or dealing with a sensitive manner, you may adjust your line of questioning accordingly to put the patient at ease. If the patient continues to give vague answers, it may be because they don't understand the question or because they may not know how to describe their symptom/situation. In case of lack of patient understanding, when asking a question looking for detail try rephrasing instead of repeating in response of a vague answer. After asking a broad question, it would also be appropriate upon receiving a vague answer to provide explicit potential descriptions that relate to the subject. Silence as brought up by Jaclyn and Zhong is an effective tool to gain more information and also gives the patient some space to think. Nonverbal cues, such as nodding , or even a brief "mmh" to agree with the patient, will affirm that you are actively listening, which can also result in more specific information gained as the patient begins to trust you.
In addition to the open ended questions and giving the patients a list of answers, I think its very important to make use of silence. Maybe just wait a little bit that way the patient won't feel rushed and they may think of other additional information.
As Madeline mentioned below, it is very important to listen to the patient and obtain information that is as accurate as possible because studies have shown that over 80% of diagnoses are made based on patient histories alone. Studies have also shown that a mixture of open-ended and focused questions is the most effective communication method for physicians and patients. Therefore, the difficulty lies in the fact that physicians must balance patient experience with clinical expertise and know when to transition from open-ended to focused questions. From my shadowing experience in Internal Medicine, I understand that time is a limiting factor in the hospital setting, as physicians often have under 10 minutes to take a history of a patient with multiple, complex complications, so I was wondering how physicians can be thorough in a short amount of time without leaving important details unasked?
Ideally, a patient interview should be initiated with open-ended questions. Essentially, this approach allows the patients to discuss their thoughts/feelings about the their medical problems. This also tests the interviewer's ability to actively listen and garner important information that would help the patient. The patient is given the opportunity to express his or her views regarding the chief complaint without interruptions by the interviewer for clarification. Using phrases such as "could you please tell me more" allows the patient to divulge a wide spectrum of information. As a result, the interviewer could be receiving extraneous or vague information in addition to the chief complaint. In this scenario, the interviewer should tailor his or her questions to address more specific concerns about the medical problem. Upon using active listening skills, the interviewer should refer back to the general chief complaint that the patient mentioned. Moreover, the interviewer should display empathy toward the patient in an effort to make the patient feel comfortable and more inclined to express their concerns. Another strategy I witnessed while shadowing in the Pediatric Gastroenterology Clinic last week was the concept of paraphrasing the vague information that the patient explained and providing additional adjectives to help the patient describe the information. The physicians would use more descriptive words and phrases to translate the vague statement offered by the patient to a more detailed and specific response. It is also important to be cognizant about doing an accuracy check to confirm the validity of the newly acquired information. Also, a physician I was shadowing at the clinic last week asked her patients to be more specific about the descriptions of the problems they were encountering. She explained that doing so makes the patient aware that the physician is actively listening and is truly making an effort to help the patient. Also, when the patient gives vague responses, the interviewer can use leading or clarifying questions that direct the patient toward a more specific answer. As the interviewer, it is important to assist the patient in providing a descriptive and detailed response by providing other options for the patient, such as listing out some associated symptoms that the patient had not already thought about, but could be experiencing. One physician I shadowed explained that there are a multitude of methods that contribute to receiving a more holistic answer from the patient and it requires substantial time and effort to master these concepts.
When a patient provides vague answers, the best way to receive more specific information is to guide the patient into answering other questions that the interviewer has. For example, in the simulation, there were times when Walter was not being very specific or he did not know how to answer the open-ended questions. My character went on to ask Walter specific questions about the type of pain Walter had, to which Walter was then able to answer. I feel as if that strategy can be effective. Also, accuracy checks with extra information can help the interviewer pinpoint information. Multiple times during the interview, the accuracy checks helped uncover new information for the provider.
I think that the most effective way to get more information out of the patient is by understanding the patient. Patient's may not answer completely because of comfort level. I feel like this is true in many cases and the doctor should make the patient feel as comfortable as possible. This could be through making a joke, telling a story, asking them to talk alone, or by talking to them with a family member or friend present. I feel like this changes in each case. Sometimes the doctors will need to remind or inform the patient why they need all of the information and the importance of it all. I feel like this would best be done without fear, but is it appropriate sometimes to remind the patient that without disclosing all the information possible the dangers that exist? Getting the patient to reveal all of the information is a matter of tact and something that (I'm assuming) doctors improve on over time if they are not stubborn. Some things will limit the effectiveness like bad previous experiences with healthcare. The provider should also try to ask as applicable of questions as possible and explain the reasoning behind it.
Like we said in small group discussions, it is a combination of all these ideas to get better information from a patient when he or she is being vague. Silence to allow more time to answer and elaborate, changing questions to be more open-ended, and providing examples of the attributes or kind of information we are looking for would all help the patient understand that they should provide more information. Because they do not know what kind of information we are looking for, it is our job to guide them.
The best way to give more information is by initially asking the open ended question then later narrowing in to allow for a more specific response. By doing this we allow the patient to essentially guide the conversation in the direction that will best help the physician in determining the primary cause of the disease. So for example, as Walter stated that he felt pain in his leg, the next thing to do would be to ask "Where does the pain hurt the most" or "On a scale of 1-10 how badly does the pain feel?"
I think using the silence technique can get more information out of the patient. They will probably continue to explain what they were saying and most likely will gives more specific information. If this doesn't work, you can say "tell me more about that." "Is it ....? " Or, re ask the question because maybe the way you phrased it was a little confusing and the patient did not really understand what you were looking for, hence the vague answer.
The patient may be vague because he/she is uncomfortable discussing the question, is not sure what the provider is asking, may be reserved, or does not want to cooperate. The general protocol for taking a history is to start out with broad open-ended questions and then narrow them down with closed-ended questions to get more specific information. If a caregiver is present with the patient, they may be able to fill in details that the patient does not. This might also provide a more objective viewpoint. In the case of a patient who doesn't trust the provider, the provider should reassure them that they will be well taken care of and remind them that they are required to keep conversations confidential. Reminding the patient that all conversations are confidential may also be important for uncomfortable questions, such as when taking sexual history. If the issue is that the patient does understand what the provider is asking for, the general protocol of asking more specific questions in a chronological order should work. This would give the provider more details about the progression of the illness. If the patient is having trouble remembering things in general, you might want to test them for memory issues, especially if the patient is at risk because of head trauma or old age. Reminding the patient of their confidentiality could also help with a reserved patient. If the patient simply does not want to cooperate, the provider can remind them that they are at the doctor's office in order to receive care, and that the doctor cannot help the patient if he is uncooperative. The ideal interview is a dialogue between patient and provider directed toward a common goal � the patient�s health. In addition to giving more detail for doctors to work off of, patients who feel that their history and opinions are taken seriously could feel motivated to be more active participants in their medical care.
When a patient is giving vague answers, I think there are a couple of different strategies that could be used. First of all, just ask the patient to elaborate further on a certain detail or situation. Sometimes the patient is just not aware how specific the physician wants the information to be, and once prompted to go into more detail, they will. However sometimes this is not the case and the patient will refuse or is incapable of going into further detail on his own. In this instance the physicians best bet may be trying to ask more specific questions to gather hints and hopefully hone in on the desired subject. Another strategy could be that the physician summarizes what all the patient is telling him; sometimes, while hearing a summary of what they said, the patient will realize they missed something or they will automatically correct your vague summary by going into specifics if when hearing it out of somebody else's mouth, they realize that their initial answer was too ambiguous.
When a patient gives vague answers, I would use a phrase such as "Tell me more about..." while including more details about possible symptoms or issues with pain that could give the patient an in or open up the door for them to start talking more about what is going on. By asking specific questions, the patient has a better idea of the kind of information you are looking for.
One way to get more effective information is to provide more examples to the patient that are relevant to whatever questions are being asked at the moment. I also agree with Justin about using silence as an effective tool when appropriate.
If a patient gives vague answers, I would try to ask more specific questions. It may be that they are confused and a little guidance on what to talk about might be helpful to the patient.
I agree with most of the other comments: using more specific questions would help the patient reveal more about his symptoms. I think the simulator did a pretty good job in getting more specific info. When Walter was vague about where the pain was/how the pain felt, Alexandria (sp?) gave specific examples to show Walter what she was looking for. That helped get better descriptors for the healthcare providers to use. Kyle also brings up a very good point; revisiting information later on through accuracy checks/summaries--at least in this scenario--helped ensure the validity of the info and often brought in new info.
This is one of the more difficult aspects of patient interviewing. When we learn to take patient histories, we are told to ask more open-ended questions in order to let the patient tell us as much as they can without being interrupted or forgetting something. At the same time, it is possible that the open-ended question itself is so vague that the answer is not exactly what the medical professional is looking for. Therefore, in a way, vague answers can also be the result of ambiguous questions. To solve this, the medical professional must strike a delicate balance between asking a directed, yet broad question that allows the patient to cover a variety of things while still focusing on the situation at hand.  Practicing active listening can also help to obtain more specific information from the patient. Maintaining eye contact, focusing on the patient�s nonverbal behavior, and practicing empathy can help to make the patient more comfortable and willing to converse with the medical professional. As in the simulation, it is possible that the patient may feel that it is unnecessary to talk with the medical student in a prolonged manner and would much rather see the physician faster. As a result, the patient may also leave out information in an effort to speed up the history process. As the medical student, we have to be able to acknowledge the patient�s concerns while trying to explain the importance of a good medical history. Recognizing and addressing the patient�s concerns are also a part of active listening and can help to make him or her more comfortable. Apart from this, the other thing that we can do is to try and focus on the chief complaint at hand rather then focus on any other miscellaneous problems that the patient may be having. For example, in the simulation, the patient was also experiencing back pain and stress that were complaints that the medical student could have continued to pursue. However, the correct response in the situation was to focus on the chief complaint at hand, which were the headaches, and try not to shift the patient�s attention from that. This could also help to get more direct answers from the patient concerning their main symptoms.
This question actually reminds me of one of our recent small groups, where all of the SHAPE/PACT students were acting as the interviewer, and Dr. Rubin was our patient (it was actually a very funny ordeal). When we would ask questions as a team, Dr. Rubin as our patient would give very simplistic answers,and there were times where we as a team didn't know exactly how to get more information out of him. It seemed that the best option in situations like these are, as mentioned below, to ask for specificity on questions. It is completely reasonable for a patient to not want to talk about their problems with someone who seems to be a stranger with a white coat on, and therefore it is our jobs as physicians to understand this and know how to work around it. I think the best ways to get more specific information are to, first, establish a comfortable, working relation with the patient. You want the patient to feel like they can tell you whatever is on their mind and whatever they have been experiencing without judgement. Second, if the answers are not sufficient, the physician should be trained to use leading questions and ask for elaborations without being pushy. It's a tough connection and balance to establish in just one visit, but it is essential to our roles as physicians. We cannot expect the patient to learn our language, but instead must be able to communicate with the patient on their level. That is the key to gaining the information we need to make a proper differential.
If a patient gives vague answers, it would be important to not only pause to give them an opportunity to add additional information or say more, but to also guide them in the right direction by asking more specific questions to narrow down your search.
If a patient is giving vague answers, perhaps it is because they are not familiar with the level of detail required to make assessments in medicine. For this reason, the physician can prod or direct the patient to give more details by asking more specific questions. For example, if a patient like Walter complains of headache, the physician can learn more by asking where the pain is most severe and what the pain is like. Also, silence can be a valuable tool to be used by the physician. It allows the patients a few extra moments to think and ponder about what they are feeling and how they would like to communicate. In the moments of silence, patients can be inclined to suggest any afterthoughts they have or concerns that they didn�t previously recall or think were relevant.
When provided with vague or ambiguous answers from a patient during an interview, the interviewer could begin asking more specific questions. By asking increasingly specific or even yes/no questions, the interview can lead the patient towards generating the intended response so that the necessary information is obtained. For instance, this could be accomplished through asking specific questions about any possible symptoms which could lead to pertinent information about what the patient is experiencing as well as what they are not. In addition, the interviewer can ask leading questions which do not appear opinionative or convey a sense of disagreement upon the patient but instead serve to guide the patient towards an appropriate area of discussion in the hope that vital information is revealed. Continuing upon the type of questions to be asked, the interviewer could begin by asking open-ended questions which provide the patient with an opportunity to expand in a certain field of discussion. But when further specific information is required, the style of questioning could be switched to close-ended instead, which would ultimately result in the patient providing the desired answer. Furthermore, through a sense of compassion and empathy, the patient-physician relationship can be strengthened which could increase the patient�s level of comfort, possibly resulting in the patient providing more information.
I would reword the question to see if that makes him understand how crucial his answer is. Otherwise, I would wait till the end of that segment and summarize what he has told me, and ask him if he has anything to add.
Either ask the questions in a different way or in a more direct way. Take some details the patient gave in the vague answer and ask them to elaborate on them.
I would stay focused on the subject they are being vague about. More specific questions can lead to the more specific information you need. Then, i would ask if the patient has any other relevant information about the subject to tell me.
Based on the patient's answers, I would ask follow-up questions that are more direct. The patient may not remember to tell me all of the information, so asking them to elaborate may prompt them to open up.
I would start asking more pointed and specific questions. The vague answer is helpful, as it gives me a good starting point. I would start asking more and more follow up questions, perhaps giving some pauses as so to let the patient elaborate a little more.
I will probably transition from asking open-ended questions, to close-ended questions that require more specific answers. I may also leave more of a pause in the conversation which may cause the patient to elaborate more on his or her symptoms. This way, I will get more important information from the patient that will help me arrive at a diagnosis.
When a patient gives vague answers, I can get more specific information by asking more specific, narrow questions that might drive the patient to give more detail-oriented answers. Also, giving a few seconds of silence can work because the patient may want to fill the silence and tell more detailed information that may have not been addressed earlier.
In the case of vague answers, I would ask more direct and specific questions regarding the vague answer in order to clarify and expand upon things like exactly how long, how much, or where exactly. This may be more tedious, but it would allow for the gathering of more information both verbally and non-verbally as I continue to interact with the patient. I would end this type of direct question and answer with a summary and by asking if there is anything else the patient would like to tell me about.
I can get more specific information by repeating key words the patient uses or by summarizing the vague answers and then phrasing my next question to be more closed-ended.  I can also ask for answers that are more quantifiable so that the patient gives me a definite answer.
I could receive more specific information by using the techniques we learned from the communication mentor session. By using techniques such as using open ended questions and being empathetic, I can encourage patients to reveal more details. After receiving some initial details, I can then use specific and closed-ended questions to receive more minute details about a specific statement or condition.
Generally, patients offer vague responses when given the option through open-ended questions. I would taper my questions off from more general to more specific, especially with regards to location and quality. If the patient is not being compliant, I would amplify phrases such as "Can you be more specific about...?" To have them be more willing to share relevant medical information.

Sorry guys, my computer malfunctioned and I can't seem to delete past posts.
When a patient presents an interviewer with vague answers, more specific information should be gleaned from pointed questions about topics and vague answers broached by open ended questions.  With medical knowledge, presenting plausible symptoms that could arise given speculation as to the nature of the condition would help coax other helpful information from the patient.  Additionally, exploring the situational events the precipitate symptoms would yield more helpful and specific information.
In order to receive more specific information, I would repeat key words in the patient�s description and turn them into more direct questions. Furthermore, I would provide a brief summary so that he can catch any inconsistencies in the information given and would then ask him if he wanted to address anything else about his condition.
I would try to get more specific information by asking more specific questions, using key words, pausing for a 3-second silence, and using other active listening techniques to assure the patient that I am receptive and understanding. Empathy and assurance that I have time for the patient will most likely make the patient feel comfortable and prod them towards giving me more information of their own accord.
I would ask the patient to elaborate by providing examples of different qualifiers. For example, if a patient states that they suffer from head pain, I might ask if the pain is sharp or stabbing. I would also refer to additional attributes such as time, quantity, etc. Furthermore, at the end of the interview, I would be sure to ask the patient if they felt any details were missed.

If the patient is giving vague answers, I would begin asking questions with yes/no answers.This may give me more information about what the patient is experiencing. Furthermore, asking questions that target particulars of the pain/sickness the patient is experiencing will result in more detailed answers. Furthermore, I would ask about the 7 characteristics of the pain: location, setting, quality, quantity, timing, affected factors and associated manifestations.
I would move from open ended questions to closed ended questions and perhaps give them examples. For example if I them how a rash feels and they say it hurts and give no further description of the pain, I might say "Does it ache, burn, itch, or how exactly does it feel?" Additionally, I could ask the 5W's (who, what, when, where, why) about a vague answer they might give me
I can use the different methods we learned in mentor session to get more information from the patient. Using active listening techniques like accuracy checks, paraphrasing and rephrasing, I can let the patient have a chance to expand on what he or she has concerns with.
Encouraging the patient to go into greater detail may be done through providing more specific examples. However, caution should be taken with implying certain answers, so the examples should still be vague enough for patients to fill in the blanks.
I would ask first ask them if they would explain more about their answer and leave room for silence for the patient to possibly speak up more. I would also ask them more direct question as opposed to an open-ended question to get more concise answers. I always have to make sure the patient is comfortable with my presence and feels that he/she can divulge pertinent information to me.
I agree with all of the comments below.  More information can be provided by giving examples to the patient so that he/she can choose the most accurate statement given their symptoms.  This week after observing pediatric patients, I have noticed that vague answers are especially common among kids, as they may not know how to fully describe how/what they're feeling.  In this case, caregivers play an enormous role, and I have seen that physicians who provide examples/statements that kids can relate to may receive essential information from the child.
Keep asking the patient questions related to the topic. The more you can find out about the patient the better

It may be beneficial to ask:Do you feel that you can continue with this interview?What do you think might be causing your symptoms?What are the statuses of your immediate family? (if alive, any conditions? if not, cause of death?) This could be a screening question on a form.How would you rate your pain on a scale of 1-10?Any allergies or medications?Any changes in the past week to your diet/exercise levels/ environment?
I would have asked more questions about his social history, family history, past medical history, medications, allergies, and done a review of systems in the end to make sure I covered everything.
Sorry! To clarify: when I redid the episode, it does ask the pain level.To Walter:How much coffee do you drink each time a day?Did you go to the doctor/pharmacy for your cold?
It would have been informative to ask about the patient's previous surgical and medical history in more depth than what was offered. There is a chance that we missed a surgical procedure that could have been medically relevant in this setting. The closest thing to this that I personally encountered was when Walter was asked about the history of the present illness and about the medication he was taking. In the same vein, it might also be prudent to ascertain whether or not Walter has any medically relevant or outstanding allergies.
The scenario did a good job of covering the seven attributes, but like Simi said, lacked questions concerning past medical history, family and social history, and a review of systems.
I would have asked more questions regarding review of systems.
It may have also been helpful for the medical student to go through the review of systems questions.  The student did ask Walter questions pertinent to the symptoms he had mentioned (for example, when Walter was discussing his headache, the student asked if he had also been experiencing any confusion, since that could be another related symptom).  However, questions about the state of his cardiovascular system, HEENT, skin, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, etc. may have elicited more information about other symptoms that Walter didn't realize were important or present (for example, he may not have been fully aware that he was also experiencing mild shortness of breath or constipation).
As Madeline mentioned, I believe it is important to follow up on Susan's comment about Walter drinking a lot of coffee and using the bathroom "a dozen times a day" because it may be linked to the potential differential diagnosis of Type 2 Diabetes. I would ask Walter how frequently he went to the bathroom and how long his habit had been going on. Walter seems to have the Type 2 Diabetes symptoms of fatigue, intense headaches (possibly due to blood sugar lows), blurry vision in his left eye, tingling and weakness in his left arm, dizziness, and even once losing consciousness. Adding to Shivani's comment, it would be important to ask if Walter ever has dry mouth, recurrent infections, skin itches, or slow-healing sores or cuts to more accurately determine the possibility of Walter having Type 2 Diabetes instead of a neurological disease. In case it may be relevant, I probably would have asked for more detail about Walter's personal and social history, including sexual history.
I would have asked if Walter or Susan had any questions or concerns at the end of the scenario. I would have also given Walter an overall summary of what we had talked about during the appointment to make sure that I did not misunderstand anything and to give Walter an opportunity to clarify or add anything else. I also agree that more information was necessary for the social history, past medical/surgical history, and review of systems.
Some of the symptoms that Walter had are indicative of a stroke: numbness in one arm, sharp unexplained headache, blurry vision in only one eye, sudden dizziness, and sudden unexplained weakness. Because a stroke is a very serious condition, I would ask him if he had any other symptoms that might be indicative of a stroke � like trouble speaking or any other weakness or numbness on the left side of his body. There is also a recommended set of questions to quickly ask that has an acronym: FAST. F stands for face � you should ask the person to smile and see if one side droops. A stands for arms � you should ask the person to lift both arms and see if one drifts downward. S stands for speech � you should ask the person to repeat a phrase. (This does not seem as relevant for Walter since he is speaking relatively well.)Finally, T stands for time, because the faster a stroke is treated, the less the potential for permanent brain damage and disability. If multiple stroke symptoms are presented, as in this case, it might actually be better to ask fewer questions and work to immediately rule out a stroke before asking more questions since time is of the essence.
I agree with Nikki, I would have asked if Susan or Walter had any questions. I would have given him a summary to ensure I didn't miss anything. I would also commend him for coming to the doctors office and making a good choice. I would also like to get a review of systems, past medical/surgical history and medications/allergies.
If I could have asked the patient an additional question, it would have been pertaining to the location of the pain in his head. Walter stated the pain was worse in the back, but he did have pain all over his head. Specifically, I would have asked him to point to where the pain was the worse in the back of his head. Following this inquiry, I would have asked if the pain was radiating and if so could he trace where the pain radiated. Lastly, I would have asked if the sides of his head hurt worse than the front, and if the pain was also in his neck. I believe this would have been relevant in the diagnosis because the location of a headache can reveal a clue to the cause. In the past when I have shadowed doctors I have seen them ask patients to point to the location of pain. For example, when my sister fell and hit her head a year ago the doctor she visited asked her to trace the pain, he even specified with her finger not her full hand. He used this to determine what tests she needed and what area of her head she could have potentially damaged. I remember watching the doctor ask this because my sisters answers were vague pertaining to her pain. It struck me as a very useful technique in determining the origin and location of pain. Also, pointing to where the pain is gives the doctor a visual image and prevents misinterpretation of the patients description of pain by the doctor. Finally, I would have asked Walter to describe what about this headache was worse than the one two days ago (was it worse in the back than two days ago, or was it worse all over). I feel all of these questions would have provided relevant information about the location and quality of the pain caused by Walter's headaches.
Most of the questions that were presented in the scenario were focused on his headache and any cognitive problems. This is reasonable because the chief complaint the patient came in with was the headache. However, I think it is important to have information about the patient as a whole, which includes asking about allergies or past hospitalizations. I would have asked more about the patient's job and the cause of the headache since I felt like the interviewer skimmed this subject too quickly. In addition to this, I would have asked more questions to Susan since she seemed eager to talk. The patient seemed confused and reluctant to speak at times, and perhaps talking to Susan could have revealed crucial and relevant information.
Other questions that would have been great during the medical  interview include those of the past medical history (social, psychiatric, and family histories) and the review of systems. That way, I could gather more insight into the patient that could help supplement my diagnosis.
I thought it was interesting that the patient said the squeezing pain would come and go while lasting around ten minutes. However, when asked whether anything helped the pain or changed the pain the patient claimed that it was constant. I feel like there should have been an option in the interview to ask this.
Like everything posted before, the important things that were not asked were the additional medical history and if they had any questions. Also, because his pain was rated as a 12 (before we had any indication that it might be a migraine), we might have sent him to the ER.
In the scenario, I would have asked more specific questions regarding the associated vision changes and location of pain that Walter described. Before conducting an accuracy check, I would have asked Walter to follow up on his comment regarding the location of the pain being in the back of his head. This response is quite general and I would have asked him to portray how the pain radiates throughout the specific region of his head that he mentioned. I would ask him to identify the area and indicate whether the pain is consistent in that specific region. Furthermore, I would investigate more into the affected vision as I felt that the patient had more to say about the associated symptom. In addition to asking about the onset of the blurry vision, I would have questioned about the severity of the symptoms experienced in the past. I felt as if it could be attributed to the chief complaint of a headache. It is important to ask about the onset, duration, and progression of symptoms. Hence, I would ask Walter whether his affected vision was a loss of detail or loss of contrast. I would also consider asking about any associated symptoms Walter might have experienced during his episode of blurry vision. Furthermore, I feel as if it would be important to ask Walter to describe the incident of his pain in comparison to the headache he experienced two days ago. I would delve into more specific questions to analyze and compare the consistency of the headaches. I would ask him to describe how the pain radiated on his head for the previous headache and how the quality of pain was different than the most recent episode of the headache. This approach would provide more information about the quality of the pain Walter experienced. Overall, I would ask these additional questions to the patient in the scenario to acquire a more holistic and complete patient history.
I think the physician should've asked for a Review of Systems, in which he asked several questions concerning each body system. This would allow the physician to gather symptoms and make a diagnosis of a stroke or coronary artery . He couldve asked," Do you feel shortness of breath" or " Do you have chest pains" These questions with his vital signs will allow for a more accurate diagnosis.
I agree with what Justin said about including question for the additional medical history including family and social. Additionally, there was not a review of systems check at the end, and I feel that there should have been since this was a new admitted patient.
I think I would have asked more about the family history, especially about the migraines. I also would have liked to ask Susan if there was anything else she would like to add, since she was constantly interjecting comments during the interview.
As mentioned by several individuals, having a review of systems would have been helpful in the scenario to complete the differential diagnosis. I would have wanted to go through the review of systems with Walter with a prioritized set of questions by significant events (pulmonary/cadio/neuro), first impressions of Walter, and patient population. For example as we often see in the emergency room, shortness of breath/ chest pain would be more concerning than joint pain, so an interviewer's review of systems would address these symptoms first. As discussed in lecture, this is not a substitute a complete review of systems, but this method does provide a level of focus. Regarding Charisma's observation that Walter's symptoms resemble a stroke-shows we should prioritize certain questions over others to rule out or explore certain diagnoses. Unfortunately when it is discovered that a patient requires immediate treatment, the rest of the interview may be done less thoroughly if time is essential.  I think asking order of questions could be based on our first impressions; in a real scenario we could have noticed dark circles (Does he sleep well? Stress?), his weight and how well/unwell he fits into his clothes (Appetite/nutrition/ GI tract problems or diseases?), etc. even without the review of systems to prompt us. (Specifically, I would ask Walter if he's felt tingling in other places such as his toes?)Some standard questions not asked: Does he drink alcohol? Any history of drug/substance abuse?
Collaborating with others' responses, it seems overwhelming that a review of systems would have been very helpful in helping form a diagnosis for Walter. That being said, the review of systems questions should have focused primarily on Walter's headache, fatigue, and arm pain as they could both be indicative of more serious underlying problems. Just as Charisma suggested a stroke, it is also possible that Walter could be at risk for cardiac arrest or some other very serious acute illness. His family history should have been asked about in a more in-depth level than just the migraine history, and there should have been more emphasis on exploring the connections between his symptoms.
The scenario often presented "either-or" choices. For example, when Walter touched his arm, we could ask either about his arm, or his sluggishness. In reality, I would have asked about both because both seemed relevant. The arm would have revealed another symptom, while the sluggishness would have revealed an additional condition (a cold) to the headache. In addition to being more thorough during the interview, I would have conducted past/social medical history like we have practiced before. Bethany also brings up a good point: utilizing Susan more could have revealed more information and could have build more rapport with the caregiver!
While I felt that the interviewer was pretty thorough in her examination, I think I would have done two things in addition to the questions asked. First, I would do a review of systems. It didn't seem like there was a thorough review of systems in the questionnaire, and felt that the interviewer focused more on the headache problem, while granted that was the chief complaint. Second, I would ask more questions pertaining to the condition of his heart. I don't have the medical knowledge to know exactly what these questions would entail, but the fact that his head and arm hurt might be indicative of poor circulation, and I would further inquire into that. The last thing I would ask more about is his arm. The interviewer was good to notice that the patient was grabbing his arm, I would have asked him to do a physical test right there to see the strength of his arm (I'm sure when I have more medical knowledge I'l know more about what these symptoms entail). His symptoms might be indicative of a stroke, and thus I would also ask questions pertaining to that. But other than those three areas, I think that the questions asked were pretty thorough.
When we practiced patient interviews in our small groups, we asked for a review of systems, which this module did not allow us to do. I would have asked for a review of relevant systems in the scenario if I could've.
The route that my conversation with the patient took did not really focus on the actual history of the patient. I briefly found out about his family history - that migraines run in his family, but other than that, I did not get any more detail about his familial, social, and psychiatric history. This is what a lot of people said too, but then again, I have only completed episode 1 once, so I may just not have asked the right questions.
I also really liked how So noticed that the patient was hesitant and aloof at times, and how she would use these important behavioral nonverbal cues to drive her questions. Susan, in this case, would be a good resource to use.
I agree with Smriti in that I thought that the questions that were asked were quite detailed when we picked the correct responses in the simulation. However, I would have asked more questions about the numbness and tingling in his arm and his dizziness. These are two symptoms that could be indicative of something more serious, especially coupled the other symptoms that he presented with. The numbness and tingling is something that he said he associated with his headache and is an important part of his history. Similarly, the dizziness could also indicate a more severe problem and can affect his everyday function as well. The threat of being dizzy or fainting could interfere with Walter�s life in more ways than one. It would have been interesting ask whether the dizziness or anything of that sort had ever occurred before. This would give more insight as to whether this could be a one-time thing, whether it is the beginning stages of something, or whether this consistently occurs. Asking these questions may also direct the patient interview a little more, leave less room for vague answers and will allow for more focus to be placed on the chief-complaint.
While playing the episode a couple of times, I felt the questions asked were very thorough. The seven attributes were covered in depth and I found it helpful to click the �continue listening� button to hear more from the patient. When my accuracy checks were correct, I felt comfortable moving on to the next attribute. At first, I also thought I would have liked to asked about the family history of migraines and the social history etc. Now that I know Walter had a stroke, I think it would be more important and relevant to have asked more questions to determine if he was experiencing the symptoms of stroke including but not limited to sudden weakness, paralysis of face, arms, or legs, problems breathing, dizziness, trouble walking. The module and medical student did a great job of inquiring about the trouble with vision, the tingling of Walter�s arm, the unexplained fall, and sudden and severe headache, which are also symptoms of stroke. Other things such as confusion and trouble talking were things that were more to be observed rather than questioned.
I would ask him if he knows what is wrong with him because the patient understands his body better than I do and may offer some valuable insight. I would also ask him about his emotions on the matter (ie is he worried or what are his anxieties).
The video questions were very thorough. Aside from the ones asked, I would ask the patient about how he feels about his pain, and how badly it is affecting his daily life.
I would have asked Walter to elaborate on his family's history of migraines. This could be a valuable insight into the cause of his headaches. In addition, I would also ask him about why he kept touching his arm. In the video, I could not discern whether it was just a nervous habit or if his arm was actually hurting him. In a real-life medical interview, I would most likely take note of his arm and enquire about it.
I think I would ask maybe a little more on his arm. The questions asked did not go nearly as in depth as I would have liked. Maybe it was because I messed up, but I would like the option to go back and go more in depth with that. Another thing was, as Nisha said, to question him about his family history of migraines, such as when his mother first started getting them and the nature of those migraines. Both of these would definitely help in a diagnosis and could prove to be the most important factors in the diagnosis.
I would have asked Walter to elaborate more on what happened earlier when he got dizzy and fell. I would have also asked more questions about his cognitive manifestations since this seems to be primarily a neurological problem. In addition to asking these questions, I would have also liked to gain more information about the physical manifestations and symptoms associated with the headache, as I don't think they were discussed thoroughly.
I would have continued to ask more cognitive function especially as he experienced a fall recently that may indicate some cause for weakness. Also, I would leave it more up to the patient to tell me what he thinks has caused his pain and how he feels both physically and emotionally. I would also ask if there is anything else he would like to add at the end of the interview.
Yes. I would have gone into more detail about past medical history, including hospitalizations, surgeries, medications, allergies, and psychiatric problems. I also would have asked the patient more about his social history, like social support at home and risky behaviors. At the end of the interview, I would be sure to summarize everything he told me and ask the patient if there is anything else he would like to tell me and ask if he has any other questions. I would also be sure to take the patient's feelings into account (empathize) and ask how he feels about his chief complaint and the pain he has been going through.
In addition to what the medical student asked, I would also have asked what the patient's primary goal of the visit was, as well as what hobbies or activities he has that may have contributed to his chief complaint.  I would have asked if there was anything unusual he was doing at the time that the pain began, and what makes the pain better or worse.  I would have concluded the interview by asking if there was anything I left out that the patient wanted to mention, or if he had any questions for me.
I would have asked more questions about the patient's past medical history such as previous hospitalizations, as well as some lifestyle habits outside of his work. Another important aspect of the interview would be to acknowledge and assuage the patient's and caretakers concern with his condition.
In the scenario there were limited questions that allowed Walter to explore what happened to him during his earlier headache incident, which was unfortunate.  I would have probed him more extensively into his family history of migraines, because the medical student in the scenario seemed to stop probing migraines as a plausible concern purely because Walter believed they were not the cause.  Additionally, I would have questioned him more extensively about any cognitive manifestations of the headache, because he had been experiencing so much dizziness that he had fallen down, but the reasons for this were not explored adequately.
I found Walter's family history to be extremely relevant and should have been elaborated upon. Past history of migraines in the family could have pointed towards possible treatment options and even etiology. Also, I would have been more thorough with his past experience with headaches, and tried to find more possible environmental stimuli that could have caused the progression of his complaint.
I would ask the patient if his condition hindered his daily functioning and cognition. I would also ask how frequently his condition affected him both physically and emotionally.  When ending the interview, I would ask the patient if he had anything else to address or if he had any closing questions.
I would ask the patient if his condition hindered his daily functioning and cognition. I would also ask how frequently his condition affected him both physically and emotionally.  When ending the interview, I would ask the patient if he had anything else to address or if he had any closing questions.
Primarily, I would have opted to ask further questions regarding Walter�s family history and social history. On the aspect of social history, further information regarding Walter�s occupation and typical daily activities as well as information on his diet and exercise habits would offer insight onto certain risk factors for medical conditions which Walter might be prone to. The medical student was able to cover the review of systems portion appropriately. Given the occurrence of his arm pain, possible questions regarding a history of cardiovascular disease or stroke with Walter�s family would provide useful information.
I would have conducted a more thorough family, medical and social history. Finding out more about Walter's lifestyle, hobbies, etc. could have given me a clue about his headache. I also would have asked him more about factors that either bettered or worsened his condition.
I would have asked Walter further questions about when he experiences pain during the day (either morning or night), and if it has affected his daily activities in any way. Further, I would have asked if to elaborate on any family history and past medical history. These can prove very useful to Walter's condition, especially if this headache is something that he has not experienced before.
I would ask the patient more about past medical history. For example, I would ask about past surgeries, time under the care of psychiatrist, and drug/alcohol/cigarette history. In doing so, I may be able to better understand possible sources of pain.
I would have asked him if he has had surgeries, hospitalizations previously, about his lifestyle (drugs, alcohol, tobacco), about his job, chronic illness and if he had any suspicions as to what could've been the cause of his headache. Also, I would've asked if he had any questions for me.
I would talk to the patient a bit more at the beginning of the patient interview to get a better idea of the patient's life and put the patient at ease by establishing rapport. Talking about the patient's lifestyle, daily activities, and other habits can engage the patient more fully and allow me to get a better idea of the purpose of their visit. I would also expand more into the patient's past medical history, such as past hospitalizations, surgeries, and family medical history.
Additionally, I would have inquired further about the effects of his headaches with his occupation. Otherwise, I would end the interview with "Is there anything else we should address?" and "Are there any other questions?".
I may have included more comments that empathize with the patient a little more. I would also include questions that do not deal with only the present illness but also past medical.surgical history, family and social history, etc. I would also ask how he feels about the situation and whether he us frustrated, worried or angered by his headache.
I would like to have more information on his family history. It seemed very relevant since some of his family members had migraines and this could potentially be something genetically related. I would have also asked more about his arm and how it relates to his headaches. There might be a overlying connection or they are both symptoms of something.
These are great questions that could have provided essential information in obtaining a differential.  After finding out that the patient was experiencing severe headaches (to the point where he could "hardly see" that day), weakness and tingling in the left arm, and fell the previous Sunday from dizziness, I would have administered a stroke scale test (http://www.ninds.nih.gov/doctors/NIH_Stroke_Scale.pdf).  To quickly assess the situation, the patient could have been asked to smile and raise both arms (to see if one side of the face droops or if one arm drifts downward).  In addition, the patient could have been asked to repeat a simple phrase to see if speech is slurred.  With strokes, time is of the essence, as the longer it's untreated, the greater probability that brain damage/disability may occur.
No, the interview was fairly thorough

This is a no win episode!
By stopping at the first choice where I would say something along the lines of, "I just saved a guy!" After that, the choices start talking about the patient's conditions. Because this was exposed, it led to more information about the patient being put out there and ultimately the identity of the patient. Nothing should be stated that would lead to revealing the patient's identity or the patient's medical status/history or diagnosis.
If this scenario occurred in real life, I would firstly not mention any details about the patient. Here, I felt it was wrong to talk about Walter�s personal life (the wedding, his wife) especially in a group chat that his daughter is a part of! It would have been appropriate to express excitement about helping a patient today without disclosing his symptoms, diagnosis, hospital stay, stress level, etc. If you are not sure if something will violate HIPPA, it is best to just refrain from exposing details about a patient to others.
Honestly, the best, surefire way to have prevented this situation from occurring in the game was to not engage in posting anything work-related on one's personal page online. In my opinion, such things do not belong online. However, if one does opt to post as the character did in the game, the initial response about him helping save a life but leaving it anonymous was acceptable. Vagueness is always the best course when referring to a patient's condition. When the character's friends began asking about what happened to the patient, I would have informed my friends that I could not disclose anything about the patient's symptoms on that forum, but I could possibly divulge a little more (without personal information signaling identity) as to what happened. In summary, the best way to win the game is to not go into symptoms when his friends asked.
To win this scenario, starting with the first post, I believe it is best to keep all patient information confidential, so if I were excited about possibly saving someone's life and would like to share that with others, I would probably just say, "I love my job!" because it is something anyone can say in general. Giving away even small details, such as the symptoms and family circumstance of the patient, can lead to recognition and surprise on the part of Wendy who seems to have not been informed of the stroke incident. I could have just said, �Can�t really talk about it.� in the beginning when my friends asked for more details instead of adding on more patient information. It was also not professional to make the patient�s stress, the wedding, into somewhat of a joke by adding on �LOL� although I should not have posted that information in the first place. I should always respect any issues patients may have because I should not be one to judge how easy or difficult their situation may be without experiencing life from their perspective. By not giving any information on the patient, I would not have to tell my friends to stop jumping to their own conclusions about the patient. If I wanted to educate my friends based on my experience, I could have done that by saying, �Spot a Stroke: F(ace drooping) A(rm weakness) S(peach difficulty)T(ime to call 911) You might just save a life!� I believe that this would be a more constructive way of commenting on my personal life through a professional lens.
I feel like one of the biggest mistakes made in this episode that resulted in losing the scenario as a whole was the fact that we gave away important information like admittance date (by saying "today I saw a patient that..."). If that information had not been given, I don't think the friends could have possibly made a conclusion about who the patient was, since symptoms of a headache are pretty generic. I think the turning point in the conversation really was when a friend made the connection that he knew someone who was suffering from headaches today as well.  Definitely to be more safe, though, it would have been best to just say you can't give any more information right after saying "I love my job!".
I think this scenario could have been prevented easily if the character in the game did not post about the patient in the first place. It could have been avoided by simply saying "my day was great! I helped a lot of people today" or something like that. Then if friends kept on asking more questions, you could have avoided it and started a new conversation, or said upfront that it dealt with the privacy of the patient and that you cannot expose any information.
To ascertain the correct way of handling this situation, it would be best to first examine the ways that this situation was handled wrongly. I would first like the address the issue of the patient�s daughter getting married. While a lot of the other information was minor snippets that let the �friends� of the playing figure out who the patient was, this is a huge identifying factor that would allow anyone who is familiar with Mr. Hunt�s family to identify him immediately.  Aside from this, the physician or medical student we were roleplaying as took a few steps to prevent divulging the patient�s identity or any identifying information. In the choices we could make, we always took care not to outright state the patient�s age, name, gender, or any other huge identification that would immediately allow the people who were familiar with the patient to identify him. However, the real mistake that occurred during the course of this scenario was that the physician divulged a lot of small bits of information. While these were small bits of information, sometimes even as vague as �oh, he had a migraine,� they could be molded together into a gestalt of the patient�s identity. It was extremely easy for the physician�s online friends to piece together the identity of the patient. The best way to avoid divulging identifying information, even unintentionally, is to not divulge information at all. Any small piece of information you give is just adding another piece to the puzzle. However, it is also important to note that in this situation, the physician�s friends were actively goading them for more information. In my view, it would have been better if the physician took a stand when they asked for too much information and just said something like �Look, I�m sorry, but I really can�t say anything more than I�ve said already.�
I would have revealed less information about the patient, especially unneeded personal details of his life. Mentioning information that may seem harmless can easily reveal a patient's identity, especially to those who are close to the patient. Instead, I would've left the conversation at saving a patient's life, and moved on to a different topic or not divulge any personal details about the patient.
In order to win this scenario, I could have not posted anything at all or kept the post more vague, saying something like "I had a great day at the hospital today!" If people begin to follow-up with questions, I would keep answers very general, making sure I didn't reveal any information that would break confidentiality or possibly reveal who was involved. In order to win the scenario, I would have wanted to go back to the very first part of the episode and change what was posted.
I'm not entirely sure what is meant by "win the scenario", but I feel that there should have been more opportunities to stop the conversation about Wendy, her father, and the situation at hand. i know that if I had personally been apart of this conversation I would've put a stop to it much sooner than when I was given the opportunity to by simply changing the topic.
When the friends began to ask questions about the patient, I would not have answered any of them. Even by giving a few details of the patient, the friends on the social media site may be curious and start asking even more questions. It is better to be cautious and not share any information of the patient than to share information and please the friends on the site.
Winning this scenario seems like a doomed plot from early on, given the reply prompts we are given. Each decision leaks more and more information out about Walter and Susan in such small steps that it is easy to get caught up in the station until the end when all of the friends figure out who the patient in question is. Even when choosing the more conservative response each time, a small detail such as the patient's gender, admittance date, marital status, and the pending nuptials of his daughter all surface quickly and naturally. The conversation gets out of hand and HIPPA is very clearly violated.The best way to control the situation would be to not go into further detail than the original excitant (which is merited) about potentially saving a person's life. No details were divulged (except for gender), and the actual love for the job is still very present. Even though all of the online friends were close to the patient in question, they could not have deduced who he was just based on the fact that the medical student "saved a person's life".
I agree with the others: being vague about patient details would have helped tremendously in keeping the patient anonymous. I think that actually mentioning the patient's condition opened up the door for questions, so leaving that out would have been great. Additionally, I think that I could have done a better job with telling my friends to stop digging. A few options tried to do this ("I can't go into it..." etc) but also included personal details about the patient (wedding), which I thought was less good.
I don't think there was a way to truly "win" the conversation with the choices presented in this episode. I completed the episode two times, and the second time I did it, I picked the vaguest answers possible, including the "guys, enough already" option, and the conversation still steered the same route because some of the answer still contained small details about the patient, such as his daughter's wedding. Because of this, my friends were able to guess who the patient was. Like pretty much everyone else said, despite my excitement, I would try and not bring such a topic up over the media, especially in such a big chat group where it is very easy for conversations to go too far. However, since in this scenario I chose to bring it up, I would just try and make my statements as vague as possible and nip the conversation about the topic if too much information would be relayed.
As the scenario progressed from "been able to save someone's life" to disclosing identifiable facts that ultimately lead to revealing the patient, I felt the situation snowballing out of control. Initially one out of the two options of the social media posts were relatively reasonable; there's no harm in expressing excitement in being able to help save someone's life or noting a first-hand application of classroom knowledge. However, as the player disclosed more and more information, it became obvious to the friends who the patient was. I noted I first felt that I was "losing" when I gave away the patient's gender. To maintain HIPAA, it's important to disclose only necessary information if information needs to be given. Gender helps identify the patient; it eliminates 50% of the community who suffer from severe headaches to the minds of Wendy's friends, making it easier for them to figure out it was Walter. It snowballed easily from there by giving away descriptions of the family. Just because Walter's name was never said didn't mean that he could not be identified from the information given. Although any one of these descriptions by themselves seems innocent (male, stressed wife, severe headache, stressful job, soon-to-be married daughter), altogether they piece together one unique person. To win the scenario from the start I would have diverted to conversation away from the possibility of disclosing patient information. This would have been done after the 2nd round, when the player describes being satisfied with "using what we've learned." Closing down the subject with an "I'm sorry, I'm not allowed to say," or talking about something else would have satisfied most people. If I wasn't given this choice and forced to continue, I would address Walter as "the patient" if needed, but the better choice would be to avoid talking about "the patient" at all. If my chance to intervene was even later, I would talk strictly about the symptoms of stroke (F-A-S-T) in general instead of what Walter had specifically, to divert focus away from the case. I felt as soon as we were forced to give away the patient had a daughter's wedding coming up (both choices!) there was no "winning" of the scenario, just how much could be salvaged. HIPAA in cases like these is easily broken in small towns where everyone knows each other, but with six degrees of separation in social media today, giving away case-specific information should be handled universally-just don't do it!
The options presented through this exercise would result in an inevitable loss as private medical information would be spread to other individuals that were initially not meant to become involved. This occurrence could cause further distress towards the patient and their family as they are already enduring a difficult time with this condition and the wedding they are in the process of planning. Primarily, to win it would have been wise to limit posting information on a social media site unless it is essentially necessary or can result in further help towards the situation. However, as the student did choose to post, he made the mistake of breaching the boundaries dictating patient privacy and unfortunately revealed the information necessary for his peers to determine the identity of the patient in this situation. The first occurrence of revealing too much information was at the moment the student stated that the patient had a severe headache and that it was not a migraine but in fact a stroke. Sharing this information was unnecessary and provided the audience with initial facts. Furthermore, the student then decided to reveal that the patient was involved in the process of planning a wedding and that his wife appeared apprehensive and distressed due to this situation. Sharing this information was unnecessary and unprofessional, as it cleared any sources of ambiguity among the social network users and allowed them to realize Walter was the patient of discussion. Instead, if the student had merely avoided sharing any medical information and had stopped the conversation after his first comment or even possibly avoided posting that comment, then private health information would not have been revealed. Furthermore, the student should not have continued to share personal information about the patient�s daily activities or his wife. Through these actions, a sense of privacy and respect would have been successfully maintained for the patient.
In this situation, I think the best thing that could have been done is to not bring up this situation at all. The social media platform is not one in which we should discuss our professional life - both the successes and the failures. Regardless of how harmless the initial discussion might be, it may not ultimately end that way. Especially for medical professionals, engaging in any type of conversation about the workday and/or patients (no matter how vague you think you are being in terms of patient identification) on social media or anywhere else that is inappropriate is a direct violation of HIPAA. This can have a multitude of consequences, least of which could result in you losing your job. In addition to this, the patient could find out about this and could pursue legal action as a result of the violation of HIPAA and could also cause the patient emotional distress. Also, as evidenced by the simulation, the family members of the patient could also find out about it through social media � in this case, the daughter. Based on her reaction, it can be concluded that she knew nothing of her father�s condition meaning that either that knowledge was not shared with her or that her father was actually healthy. In the latter case, a rumor has been started that is completely unnecessary and inexcusable. All of this could have been avoided by simply not bringing up this subject in the first place. If someone on social media asks about your day specifically, the best response would be to politely say that you are not allowed discuss it. This response could prevent a very serious situation such as the one present in the scenario from occurring.
The best way to win this scenario would be to not talk about any details about the patient at all. Even after leaving out the patient's identity, someone was able to identify who it was based on the symptoms and circumstances. It is best to never reveal any information - even anonymous information - in any public setting.
It seemed like no matter what options were presented, the doctor just gave to much information that allowed the commenters to determine the identity of the patient. RIght of the bat, when the people asked what was wrong with the patient the doctor should not have even described symptoms such as the headache, pain or possible migraine. And to make matters worse, he mentioned a wedding that some of the people could've easily been invited to .This was one of the more important indicators that allowed people to identify the patient as Walter. The more proper method would have been to say that this individual(not revealing the gender) was stressed about a big event soon. This keeps it very broad and makes it very difficult for anybody to guess that this big event is a wedding Moreover, he should've simply said that 'today i diagnosed a patient with stroke.' By doing this he minimizes any details, keeps from revealing any patient history or any social history. However in this episode, the doctor even went so far as to say what the wife thought Walter had a migraine. This could've easily led to the discovery of the patient if any of the commenters had recently had a conversation with Walters wife. It seems like regardless if we were able to keep the people from determining Walters identity, this entire conversation is a violation of HIPPA. Doctors have a duty to protect the privacy of the patient and to ensure complete privacy it is best to not post anything about a patient on social network
In an effort to win this scenario, I would have taken a more cautious approach to dealing with friends or family on social media. Personally, I would choose not to disclose information regarding work in the first place or even the topic of it for that matter. However, for the sake of this episode, I will assume that the motion has already been initiated. As my friends and family start responding to my post regarding the successful day at work and begin to ask more specific questions regarding the actual medical problem, I would politely respond by stating that I am legally not allowed to disclose any information about patients I see in the hospital. I would also explain that this precaution is taken for the safety and security of the patients and to respect each and every patient�s privacy and confidentiality. Furthermore, it is important to be cognizant of the fact that even disclosing general information can be detrimental to not only my job but also the patients. This action would leave my friends and family disappointed about my reluctance to share information with them. Despite this fact, it is important to remember the significance of the patient-physician relationship and how it is essentially based on trust, which entails privacy and confidentiality.
There was no way to win this scenario given the conversation options presented to us.  The best way to handle this situation is to not let it occur in the first place.  In today's world, sites like Facebook and Twitter have become an integral part of society.  Now, it is even more essential to maintain professional online behavior and patients' confidentiality on all forums at all times.  There is no way to gauge how far-reaching a post or comment can be on social media sites - a friend's friend, or even strangers can access any post.  While observing an internal medicine team last week at Parkland, we had just completed rounds with a visit to a terminally ill patient and his primary caregiver.  The team continued to discuss the patient's situation after leaving the room, and immediately stopped as we were entering the elevator.  As individuals left the elevator, I noticed that the caregiver had been standing completely unnoticed in the back the whole time.  It would have been very inappropriate to have continued the conversation and unintentionally divulged information to the patient's family.  In the scenario, that is exactly what ended up happening as a result of a seemingly innocent post about one's successful day at work.  As students and future physicians, it is vital that we remember the potential implications of posting on social media and do no harm.
I do not think that anything could be done to �win� this situation as presented. Unlike in the previous episode, there were not �right� answers a lot of the time. I find the situation rather unrealistic for a couple of reasons. There were no options to stay quiet, or just inform your friends about symptoms of a stroke when they asked without giving away more personal information about the patient. In addition, I would like to think that no one would post information about peoples� family members in a forum where they can easily access it. In real life, the proper method for preventing this disaster would be to not mention anything at all. I understand the desire to share your joy with the world, but revealing information in a close community where there is any chance of your patient�s privacy could be compromised is undoubtedly a bad idea. When teaching, doctors often share information about their patients � for example, out weekly sessions teach us a family of five, and we even saw a picture of them. With the picture and detailed health and social information, it might be possible to find the identity of this family. However, since they have (hopefully) given their consent, it is okay. So, if you are really motivated to share a patient story, it would be acceptable as long as you have documented consent.
I agree with Chenchita, the best thing to have done was not begun a conversation about one's daily interaction with patients in the first place. HIPPA states that you cannot share information over online media that is pertinent to the job or activities in which one participates. When the simulation gave me the option of statements to say, none were�attractive options in my opinion. For example, in one option both�anwsers�mentioned the patient was preparing for his daughters wedding, which revealed personal information that could be linked back to the patient. Omitting a patient�s name�does not�completely protect�the patient. If the situation is rare it might reveal the identity of the patient, just as Wendy's father was in this episode. To�be successful in this scenario, no information about the patient's own life or medical history should have been shared. When presented with questions from friends one should respectfully explain giving out this information would violate patient confidentiality. This situation shows that one must be extremely perceptive about what they are sharing, and even if one thinks they are not giving much information it is better to give none at all to ensure the safety and privacy of the patient. One real world example, of a doctor posting patient information on Facebook, was in 2011. Dr. Thran in Rhode Island was fired about posting about a trauma patient in the ER. She did not post the patient name but wrote enough about the patient that those in the community were able to determine the identity of the patient. This�example�and the situation portrayed on the TIME portal exemplify the disastrous affects of posting any patient information on online media.
I do not necessarily think it was possible to win this scenario because all of the responses gave away too much information (for example it revealed that the patient was a man, that he had a wife, that he had a daughter who was getting married, that he had his own business). However, I think that was the point of this episode because we were able to see how easy it is to reveal protected information. But I agree with Akshay and Courtney that the conversation should have been stopped much earlier. In fact, to prevent such a situation from happening, it is best that the medical student not reveal any aspect of their work because it is natural for friends to be curious if you say that you saved someone's life. While the medical student is allowed to feel good about his/her diagnosis, it should stay between the patient and the care team.
Nothing. The options did not change the replies received on social media. Some of the options were perfectly fine to post on social media, but once the simulation got a few answers in there was no right and and both divulged too much information. There was no reason to be posting anything specific especially if Walter really was a friend. There is generally no reason to post anything identifying on facebook or other social media. As can be seen from my facebook, I rarely post at all. I don't think social media will cause as many problems as just talking to people potentially would. It's much harder to tell people that you can't talk about things with them in person. I feel like they should have created some scenario where you could win this episode so the impression that we all just need to stay off social media would be avoided. I feel like social media isn't a bad thing but using it improperly is. For example, posting risk factors for a stroke or symptoms without saying anything about a patient might help somebody become aware that they are at risk.
I would have generically answered that I had a good day, and not gone into detail that I had saved anyone's life.  I would have asked about someone else's day after answering in little detail how my day was.  I also would have kept the information about the upcoming wedding confidential.
I think I agree with Nikki in that I would choose not to post any status or share any information about a specific patient encounter on any social media site. As we saw in this episode even the smallest detail can spark curiosity and conversation that can jeopardize patient confidentiality. I would stop the conversation early on and not share any details. If you wish to share information about your day on a social media site, I would keep it very general and not refer to a specific patient.
To win this scenario, I would have started out by simply saying "I love my job!". Given any further inquiry I would have just said "I can't talk about it but I had a great day at work today." And if people still pressed further my only reply would be "I can't talk about it! There are laws guarding patient information rights so I legally cannot discuss anything further". There is no reason I should disclose any patient identifying information, whether it be related to their health or social/family history. Anything you put on the internet is in effect permanent since even if you delete it the data is stored in some server somewhere.
Like everyone said, the best thing to do in this scenario is to not post about it at all. However, I think that's easier said than done. This scenario made our choices for us, but this is not so in the real world. Most of us social network users will agree it's not that hard to abstain from posting on our News Feeds about patients that we saw, but what we sometimes forget is that social networking goes beyond just profile posts. Private messaging, FB group posts, and text messaging are also ways where we can communicate patient information digitally, and I think these are instances where we need to exercise more caution. When talking to normal friends, its easier to be aware of HIPPA violations, but when we talk to our friends who are also in the health care field, its easier to slip up and reveal patient information (hence, the infamous "patient conversation in the elevator" by doctors). I think to respect our patients fully, we need to be cautious and aware in all situation, whether we are talking on social networking with normal friends, or health care friends, and whether that is on public posts or private messages.
Given that the patient was a friend's father, not discussing any details about the patient may have prevented the discovery of his identity. The group nitpicked over every detail, so not sharing any information would have been the best option.
The best way to successfully approach a scenario such as this one is to avoid using social media, like everyone else has mentioned, in any form regarding a physician's patients. We have learned that physicians are expected to follow professionalism in every environment, including social media. This includes understanding that posting any patient information, no matter how vague, is never acceptable. As we learned through this simulation, a simple post about a patient's treatment can escalate so quickly within social media that it ends up violating patient confidentiality; even if the physician never meant to do so.
I agree with the below statements that this episode seems to have been designed in a way that doesn't allow anyone to win. As Nikki said, the point is rather to demonstrate that discussing patient information on the internet, in any form, can be a violation of HIPAA and patient privacy. Because we were not given the option to leave the module at any time or submit our own responses, we were forced to reveal certain aspects of information that we did not want to reveal. It is best to simply avoid discussing healthcare information through social media altogether.
Apparently nothing I could have done would help me win the scenario. I was given two options, both of which I always knew were wrong. I guess the point of this was to show that revealing anything on social media is a violation of HIPAA and can reveal information about your patients. Basically, it drove home the point to not reveal anything about your patients on the Internet
Going in, I should have known that these people are familiar with the patient because he is a friend's father. Thus, I should not have even talked about him in the first place because they were easily able to put the few details together and deduce who the patient was, which is a violation of HIPAA and his rights to patient privacy. There was no reason for them to know about the case anyway.
Nothing because no matter what option you pick, you will share too much information
Although I should not have posted a comment regarding a current patient on a social networking site, I must deal with resulting questions by refusing to share specific information. Things such as gender, symptoms and social history can compromise a patient's identity.
To win the scenario, I should not have released information pertaining to a patient on a public site, because it's inconsiderate as well as a violation of HIPAA. In this module there was no way to win because at a certain point it only offered options that were inappropriate responses for the situation
It was not right to be talking about the patient on social media to begin with. To win the scenario, I could have avoided saying anything at all. It is inappropriate to talk about a patient in a non-healthcare setting or in an environment that is not secure.
Because I knew the patient was a friend's father I would have not given any details about the patient to begin with. The episode went downhil once me mentioned the wedding, because that is very identifiable information. This is a major violation of HIPPA, and he was meant to keep patient information private.
Agreed, its wrong to be talking about patient information to other people let alone on a public social media website. I think in order to win this scenario you should stop the conversation before it goes to talk about how this person may be Wendy's dad because thats personal information that now everyone knows. The best is to not even participate in the conversation in the first place
This scenario was difficult as many of the individuals online were quick to assume certain details. However, I could have initially refrained from giving any of the details concerning saving the patient. Simply by stating that I saved someone's life would be enough, instead of sharing the symptoms I saw. In fact, not participating in such a conversation or not sharing any details of what I did at work is even better. Furthermore, by stating that the patient would be fine in time for his daughter's wedding is inappropriate for this conversation. By simply not sharing details of the experience or of the patient, I would be able to win the scenario.
I would not have revealed so much information about the patient. Disclosing a patient's personal information on a social media site violates protocol. Instead of continuing with talking about my day, I would have in turn asked someone else how their day was after saying I had saved someone's life today. Although you might think that your friends on social media won't do anything to jeopardize the situation, you must still be confidential about patient information as precaution.
To make sure that the patient's identity was not revealed, I would have said I had a good day at work and ended it there. If anyone probed me for more details about my day, I would not have revealed anything because you never know which way a conversation can turn or how others will react to certain information. Everything on social media is public, powerful, and permanent. Avoiding all talk about patients and gearing the conversation towards another topic is any healthcare professional's best bet on social media.
The patient was clearly a well-known individual who had personal connections to many of the people within this social circle; therefore, I would not have mentioned anything about the specific case I had worked on today. Instead, I would have steered the conversation towards other conversational topics as talking about this patient is violation of HIPPA policy despite everyone's well-meaning reactions and comments.
I could have not mentioned the patient or his symptoms at all, and just left the situation as vague as possible. I could have also explained to my friends that patient information is confidential, and that I am not at liberty to discuss it. If my friends kept asking me about information, I would tell them firmly but nicely that I would not discuss it, and that we should discuss something else. If the conversation progressed any further, I would have told them to stop much earlier.
In order to "win" the scenario, I would have disclosed less information regarding the patient's personal life, such as planning a wedding or owning a business. Additionally, I believe it's a good rule of thumb to not discuss events that happened the same day or even week or month, depending on the patient being discussed. This eliminates the possibility of others' deducing the patient's identity based off of time. Generally, however, I know I would have just never even placed myself in the situation where I would disclose patient information to a large number of people out of a healthcare setting.
To avoid revealing the patient's identity, I would have refrained from commenting about my day's work at all - a simple "I had a good day" would have sufficed. I also would have refrained from mentioning a wedding, business, or wife, because any of those aspects could have been traced back to the patient. In general, describing a patient's case, even when the name is not used, is against protocol and fails to meet patient confidentiality.
In order to win the scenario I would have disclosed no information that could have jeopardized the patient's identity in any way - merely mentioning that I felt gratified at treating a patient would have been the only appropriate comment.  I can never underestimate peoples' ability to deduce an individual's identity, and in order to protect myself and others, a social networking site cannot be used to divulge any pertinent information.  This scenario was especially precarious because many individuals knew the patient's family.
In order to �win� the scenario, I could have restrained from revealing any information pertaining to the patient in order to avoid HIPPA violations. When utilizing social media, it is essential that confidentiality is maintained in order to ensure the privacy of the patient.
I definitely would not have revealed nearly as much information as the character in this scenario did, in order to "win" it. I perhaps could have said something like "I think I just helped save a patient's life and I feel awesome!" or something to that effect and then just have left it. I would not have added much more information, especially in a situation where the family members were so interconnected within this social group. Even saying that the patient owned a flower shop led to the revelation of who the patient was. It just goes to show how a little, seemingly innocuous fact, can lead to an out-of-control information spiral.

Wow, it felt out of control.
Personally, I felt like it wasn't that realistic because I would not have responded in those ways. Like I said in question 1, I would state nothing more than something along the lines, "I love my job. I just saved someone." However, this episode makes me weary of posting anything related to patients, even the above statement. It seems very easy to keep talking and disastrous consequences would result as in the episode. This probably occurs more often than it should, which is never. Even throwing some small details like the patient being able to go to his daughter's wedding proved to be too much information, as that seemed to lead the other people to learn about the patient's identity. No details should be revealed. It's better safe than sorry
Honestly, I felt as though it was impossible to win this scenario because I was only presented with two options. Though I chose what seemed to be the least unprofessional of the options, somehow my friends on the social website figured out the identity of the patient. Acknowledging that I was excited about applying medical knowledge to real patients seemed appropriate. If I was aware of how curious my friends are and how many questions they would have asked, I would not even have brought up the patient case. I think it was wrong to disclose details unrelated to the actual medicine. Involving details such as the wedding and the wife made the patient more identifiable.
I feel like playing this episode really left me concerned about the way things can "explode" on social media sites.  Even though I began by selecting to say information that I didn't think could be tracked down to a single patient (for example, all I chose to say was "i love my job!" and then "i realized a patient with bad headaches was exhibiting signs of stroke instead of migraine"), somehow all my friends just came to a conclusion about who it was on their own. Realistically though I think I would have declined to give any information about the patient at all, and just go on about how I love my job, but it does show that giving away any information at all can pose a serious violation of privacy . For example, giving away specific information about the patient's symptoms ("falling to his knees from the pain" and information about his daughter's wedding) was clearly too much information since immediately all of my friends pinpointed the identity of the patient.  It was just scary to see how quickly things can get out of hand. It makes me feel like its best not to share ANY information at all, because you can never be sure what connections people can make.  In the real future, I would probably stop at just saying "I love my job" after seeing the way this conversation exploded into a violation of the patient's privacy.
This episode made me feel very sad and helpless for a few reasons. Firstly, I was very sad at the outcome of the game depicting Wendy's surprise to her father's condition and her having to find out through her friends online. That violation of HIPAA was extremely damaging to the daughter, her parents, and possibly the hospital if the woman decides sue or if it gets out that there was a privacy breach. Secondly, I felt helpless due to the fact that no matter how tactful I tried to be with the provided answer choices, there was no way for me to win the scenario. In a real scenario, I feel that there would be more options of what to say, as I know I would not have actually said some of those. However, in all, it was a pretty interesting scenario for demonstrating electronic professionalism.
I completely agree with Shivani's post. In addition, from personal experience, I understand how difficult it can be to avoid revealing patient information in your excitement from learning something new or observing an interesting case, so after this episode, I felt that the theme of not asking others about or giving away any patient information was strongly reinforced because of the serious consequences this social media situation led to with a daughter suddenly discovering that her father was in the hospital for a stroke. This emphasized that I should always think before speaking because even saying just one word more may be one word too much. Although it did not occur in this scenario, it also made me acknowledge the importance of my peers stepping in to let me know when I have made a mistake. If I saw my friend sharing patient information on social media, I would be sure to quickly contact them individually to let them know in a polite way that what they are saying is not appropriate. However, I was wondering if I would be obligated to report them for a HIPAA violation? On the other hand, I feel that it is very important to reflect on your work in some way, so I was wondering if it is appropriate to journal about your experiences in a private notebook at home, so you have some way to express how rewarding or frustrating your day may have been without publicly sharing any information? I have also been conflicted in the sense that I am not certain after what point, if any, is it appropriate to present patients in a de-identified manner as case studies because I have attended presentations in which physicians had X-rays or surgery photographs of previous patients to facilitate audience engagement and learning? This practice has confused me because it seems that based on my HIPAA training experience that physicians must take patient information to the grave. Moreover, I was wondering if the practice of physicians speaking with family members about their day, which may contain patient information, at home is appropriate because it seems like a fairly common practice to share information about work with family in private?
In response to Alice's post, I do think that if anyone, even a friend, is clearly violating privacy laws, then they probably should be reported. The best way to avoid reporting a friend (since that can obviously be a really hard thing to do) would be to try to stop them before they do it, but I can see how its possible for you to find out after the violation has taken place. I feel like it would be okay to write thoughts and reflections in a notebook, as long as all the information is still de-identified according to HIPAA regulations (for example, it would probably be best to still keep all dates, names, and other identifiers out of the notebook just in case the notebook does fall in the wrong hands). Also, I don't even know it would be allowed to have a journal full of patient information at home in general, unless the information is de-identified. As far as physicians giving presentations, again I think its okay to give educational lectures as long as the information is de-identified.  I researched the laws regarding de-identification and it seems like the laws were made specifically for use in studies/educational material.
I felt both frustrated and angry at the so-called friends this character had. I felt frustrated and helpless because I couldn't really control the direction the conversation was going and I felt angry that these friends were being so nosy about the patient. I understand that they might have thought that because it was concerning someone they knew that they felt like they had the right to know, but it was rude of them to barge into someone else's business and cause Wendy to find out about her parents through an online chat. This was just an unfortunate scenario that I hope I'll never have to confront in the future.
In all honesty, this episode made me feel a bit overwhelmed at times. For example, I�d start it off with a simple statement about how great my day made me feel, and without warning the news feed blew up with comments from friends. In addition, as Alice mentioned in her post, the point of the exercise was driven home once the daughter of Mr. Hunt came online and was shocked that her father was in the hospital. I actually tried to reply to each friend at a time, but the overall onslaught of comments prevented me from doing so. Each person wanted a different piece of information, and sooner that I knew, all those little pieces added up to something that the people on the social network used to identify who the patient was. I understood that the person we played as was very glad that he was able to provide his patient with the adequate medical attention so that the stroke was properly diagnosed, but I feel like he let his excitement override his consideration for the patient�s privacy. At times, though he said he was not allowed to give further information, he still did. Personally, I could relate with this, as my peers are constantly asking about my shadowing experiences this summer and the previous summer, and it�s not easy at times to keep track of what should be said and what shouldn�t be. I can definitely see how getting overwhelmed by people who want to know what happened in detail can lead to you divulging more information than you should. So with all of this, I feel like the only real step one could take to prevent being overwhelmed and divulging important information is to always be wary of the audience and try to not say anything about the patient if possible. Small things are small things, but they can build up quickly.
It made me feel helpless as I watched the friends on the social network start to piece together the patient's identity from the small details. I was even more distressed when Wendy, the daughter of the supposed patient, found out about her father's hospitalization through social media and gossip.
This episode made me very annoyed and sad. I did not like the options that I was given from the beginning, and I felt rather helpless as I chose to reveal information on social media to people who had no business of knowing what was going on. Also, it made me upset that my "friends" would actually talk like that on social media. There was very little respect for Mr. and Mrs. H and Wendy. Wendy should have never found out on social media that her dad was hospitalized. I felt like I was doomed to fail from the beginning of the episode, which was very frustrating.
I didn't really feel much of anything when completing this episode. I did feel a bit uncomfortable not being able to interject into the conversation sooner in order to stop it, and change the direction that it was heading into though.
It was interesting how the social media conversation escalated quickly. Like Courtney, I didn't feel much of anything during the episode. I wish there were more choices to how to respond to the comments.
I was left feeling very frustrated and helpless by the episode. It seemed as if nothing I did could have prevented the student's friends from finding out Walter's identity, and I was by proxy extremely irritated by the actions of the friends. There was a clear violation of HIPPA ongoing, but more than that the friends had a blatant disregard of privacy- all of this fueled by the social media choices made by the student. Some of the choices presented to the student as possible responses were very unprofessional, specifically the bountiful amounts of patient information doled out like candy or the casual "LOL" at the end of one response. In any case, the actions were clearly inconsiderate of Walter, Susan, and the daughter, incidentally a friend of the medical student.While the medical student seemed too late to rectify his choices to share identifying patient information, the episode was also demonstrative of the complete lack of control one has over social media. Something innocuous such as "he had a migraine" can lead to completely figuring out something very private about a person who may not be willing nor obligated to share.
The end result of this episode was fully avoidable and very unfortunate. This exercise caused me to generate feelings of helplessness, frustration, and disappointment. The choices presented in this game led to unfavorable occurrences, and while playing I pondered upon the consequences of the potential statements that would be made by the medical student. Furthermore, a sense of awareness was formed regarding the potential dangers of posting private health information on a social networking site. The use of modern technological innovations has facilitated the transfer of information. Although this capability is vital towards efficient delivery of care, the appropriate potential consequences are attached in that the transfer of information is not necessarily beneficial if taken advantage of. In the medical student�s situation, although he did not directly reveal the identity of the patient, this information was nonetheless revealed to the public on a domain accessible by numerous individuals that are not involved in the situation. This realization was appalling as it revealed the level of ease and quickness at which the transfer of pertinent information can occur. Although the medical student might have had positive intentions for the patient and did not mean any harm, ultimately the patient�s identity was revealed and attached to private health information. As a result, this information can spread to various other individuals and could cause the patient a great deal of stress. This result caused me to feel  regret for the patient and has driven me towards providing a sense of compassion and empathy to help the patient overcome this difficult time.
This episode made me feel frustrated and helpless. Frustrated that first of all, I was disclosing so many medical and personal details about this patient that made him identifiable. After my friends found out who I was talking about, I was glad that they cared about their friend and her family, but was upset with how lightly they treated the situation, especially considering Wendy was in the chat! I felt helpless having to choose between the better of two responses that were likely to disclose the identity of the patient. Like I said in the first discussion question, I feel like I wasn't able to truly "win" the conversation. This episode made me question where to draw the line of disclosing information and made me realize how fast and easily information can spread about a patient.
I felt kind of guilty and angry. The guilt stemmed from the fact that, because of me, one of my friends found out that her dad was in the hospital on a social networking site, which should never have happened. Additionally, all her many of her friends found out before her, which just seemed like adding insult to injury. The family probably didn't want to spread this information around, making this breach in patient confidentiality very disrespectful. The anger stemmed from the fact that I couldn't stop the discussion from escalating. Despite my (small) attempts at maintaining patient anonymity, my friends continued to ask questions. I definitely felt that I could have done more to prevent this from happening.
I was feeling dread as soon as I realized how little control I had with the social media simulation. I knew this would very likely not end well because social media is often discussed as a problem with HIPAA breaches in our summers.  I felt as though I facing a wall of exasperation, as many rounds I disagreed with posting either choice. I wasn't choosing between the right and wrong choice-more equivalent to choosing the lesser of two evils which both led to terrible results. As the situation progressed, the responses seem to come in faster and faster-much like Zhong stated "overwhelming." One response from Don(?) stated that he saw Walter at the hospital. I felt that this was irresponsible of Don (even more if he was at the hospital as a healthcare worker), and this situation became out-of-control. Honestly I quit the first time because of this. I also felt that the pseudo social media friends did not understand that discussing Walter in the hospital while being connected to Wendy would make her feel-there were obviously better avenues of disclosing this information involving her support group and her mother. I also thought about the notes I record in my own notes on rounds like Alice; I feel that among physicians on the same service it is ok to discuss previous cases because it is educational, as long as information doesn't go beyond disease and how to treat it. I'd be interested to learn more on medical disclosure laws and deidentification. I felt in the end I should definitely be more aware of my own use of social media and how I perceive others talking about cases whether on social media or not.
As I was progressing through the episode, I was apprehensive as to where the conversation was heading. The responses that we were allowed to choose from were not ones that I would necessarily use in a real-life situation and led the conversation to a place where it ended in a HIPAA violation. There was a portion during the simulation during which the people on the social media website were discussing the identity of the patient that was being treated. This part of the simulation was particularly worrisome, as we were not given the opportunity to respond before it was too late and the potential identity of the patient was revealed. It taught me that once you introduce the topic and give some sort of information about the patient, that there is always the possibility of his or her identity being revealed. The end of the episode was especially shocking when the daughter was portrayed to be unaware of the entire situation. When the episode came to an end, I was left contemplating what would have happened if this were a scenario that actually occurred in reality. The guilt and trepidation I experienced just during this simulation pales in comparison to what could have happened in real-life. As medical professionals, we are held to some of the highest standards of care and patient confidentiality. A scenario such as this just proves how important these standards are and how they have to be met and exceeded in order for healthcare to be provided appropriately.
This episode made me feel surprised at how quickly information can spread on a social network and allow for a clear violation of HIPPA. Even by attempting to take on the conservative approach, there was no way to keep anybody from determining the identity of the patient. It seemed like very option was lose-lose and no matter what you chose the doctor simply revealed to many details that allowed the people to piece together the puzzle. I was also shocked at the presence of multiple 'LOL' that made it seem like the doctor was laughing at the patients predicament. I didn't like it but it did allow me to realize of the dangers of social networking and its role in patient privacy. I now know that the safest method to following HIPPA is to not mention anything patient related at all. Similar to the first couple comments by the doctor, saying that this was a great day and being happy to be a doctor should be the limit. HIPPA is very important and it is better to take the safe route than say to much.
After completing this episode, I had difficulty relating to the scenario. In real life, I personally choose not to post about work/school related things on social media; hence I honestly could not see myself facing a situation similar to this. Although, I still maintain a level of professionalism while communicating with others regarding social events, sports, and other topics on social media. In the future, I could see myself becoming excited about a fascinating event that occurred at work but I would refrain from posting about it on social media.  Doing so eliminates even the potential risk of accidentally or unintentionally releasing confidential patient information. This episode had quite limiting options in regards to responding to the comments made by family and friends on the social media site. Hence, this made it difficult to envision myself in that position. The episode felt as if it was designed to probe the person using social media to accidentally or unintentionally release patient information and come to a realization that he had made a mistake. The episode made me realize that patient information could be unintentionally released to the public by subtle words and phrases that others have connections to. This has made me significantly more cautious about the content of the information that I post on social media. I learned that social media users should always be aware of the implications of their actions in the real world, especially when working in a health care setting and dealing with patients.
When it seems like, it would be simple enough to talk about your daily activities by not mentioning�patient names, one must be aware there are many other ways to breach confidentiality. This episode although very drastic shows how quickly a well meant post on social media can turn into a breach of HIPAA. I believe this episode was invented to encourage each of us to scrutinize the situation and reread every answer to understand what was happening. As the simulation began I immediately had a feeling of aversion to all the possible answer choices. Almost all of them contained patient information, and I attempted multiple times to click on anything else on the screen to avoid choosing one of the unacceptable solutions. The entire plot made me feel uneasy although it was merely a simulation. After I had completed the scenario for the first time, I will even admit I was slightly confused. I had chosen the solutions that contained the least patient information. I soon came to realize that although these answers were the best of the worst they still were violations of HIPAA. Although I knew before this episode that posting comments such as the ones we were given to choose from was wrong, this episode made me reanalyze exactly why they were wrong and what would be the correct alternative.
I agree with Courtney, I did not like many of the responses that we were given because they gave away too much information. However, this episode got me thinking about how easy it can be to give away protected health information when social networking is such a large part of our lives. Since so much of the doctor-patient relationship is now documented online (electronic health records, etc.) I realize that doctors will have to be very careful about how they handle patient information (making sure that they log off workstations that contain patient information, not posting patient information on social networking sites, designing secure passwords, using secure internet connections) because it can very easily end up in the wrong place.
While completing this episode, I felt very uneasy with the provided conversation options.  Every possibility seemed inappropriate and divulged too much information.  I was not surprised by how quickly the situation escalated.  From personal experience, I have seen the rapid dissemination of information on social media sites.  Therefore, I rarely post on social media and also had a difficult time relating to the episode like Subhadeep.  However, I was surprised that the patient identity was ultimately determined despite choosing the best options.  This simulation illustrates how even posts with good intentions can violate HIPAA regulations.
I think that people enjoy their autonomy on their social media sites � profiles are like a little space on the internet that a person can call their own. In high school and college, we generally believe that no one is monitoring your profile and checking for professionalism. However, this changes once you commit yourself to a profession, although people�s belief of relative obscurity may remain. When you interact with others, especially ones who are as quick on the uptake as the character�s friends, asserting autonomy can be dangerous to others. What made this situation especially inappropriate was that no consent was given (that we know of), and the patient�s own daughter did not know about the hospitalization. I feel that the student�s friends didn�t have bad intentions � they wanted to pray for the family and help them, but having the conversation in public online and accidentally informing the daughter undermined any kindness they might have intended.
This episode led to frustration. In the same way that you watch somebody in your life walk down the wrong path and make mistakes that ruin their life, as soon as the "oh we should call her" popped up on the screen I knew it was a major problem for the character and that he might never get to practice medicine. Even though the people who identified the patient said he would be a great doctor. It doesn't matter how great of a doctor anybody will be if they can't keep their mouth shut about some things. I feel like since the profession is highly respected in the community, doctors are held to a much higher standard. This means people will judge on the smallest things and any mistake could destroy a person's career, regardless of how "harmless" it is. I've been told multiple times that with all the technology available, never to do anything that I wouldn't want recorded and going viral in a video. If you do something dumb, somebody probably is watching and could possibly pull out their cell phone and record it. This being said there is no escape from others noticing so the only safe course of action is to act with this knowledge.
It made me feel uncomfortable when my friends started asking about my patient.  This seems like a small group of friends who all know each other, and I would have liked to say that I couldn't tell them any details because of patient confidentiality.  I felt troubled that information about a known patient's health and personal life were being posted on Social.
I felt a little frustrated during the episode that there were not many opportunities to respond or monitor the conversation. I felt like I was just watching everything unfold with no power to stop it from getting out of hand.
This episode was really frustrating because the answer choices given for the replies to the questions my "friends" were asking me were not at all what I would actually say. I would have ended this whole situation much earlier by not giving any identifying information about the patient--not his sex, age, health, social status, etc. But the episode also reminded me of how careless a lot of my friends (and sometimes myself) can be while using social networking sites.
Although it was slightly over-the-top, I understand now how an iota of information may lead to a breach of patient confidentiality. Patient anonymity and privacy should be respected, so caution should be taken when discussing these cases on social media.
I agree with Subhadeep's comment regarding having difficulty relating to the scenario while I was completing it. I have never felt that posting information about school or work is necessary on social media. Therefore, I felt that many of the choices presented during the episode were unrealistic. Furthermore, I felt that many of the posts contained the type of patient information most physicians would realize is not acceptable to be posted online regarding a patient's treatment, personal life, and diagnosis.
The episode made me feel nervous due to the nature of the conversation at hand. I felt as if it was evident that what they were doing was wrong. I was shocked as to why they felt it was appropriate to ask the questions they did knowing that they are putting their friend in an awkward position by asking him those questions. On the other hand, i would have dealt with the situation differently and not allowed for myself to be put in that scenario.
Mostly helpless, because I knew what I needed to do--stop the conversation from the get go and tell people I couldn't talk about it--but I couldn't do that because there was no way of getting out of it.
Honestly, I felt that the episode was a bit unrealistic. It's kind of already been brought up, but it seemed that in real life, most people don't go around posting things about the hospital. What really poses a threat to HIPPA violations are things that are perhaps more subtle and secretive, such as talking about patients in private or group messages. I guess the concept is similar though, and overall the situation makes me feel uneasy, because when I put myself in the patient's shoes, I would feel uncomfortable and a little hurt if I knew my doctor's were posting on social network about me. Even if they were saying nice things, I would still like to maintain my anonymity and I think most people can agree.
I felt frustrated because my friends were able to draw conclusions from the seemingly little bits of information I gave them about the case. I should have been more cautions when I was talking about this patient in order to maintain his privacy and respect his rights.
Helpless as you are forced to share too much information though social media
This episode made me feel both frustrated and uncomfortable about how little control I have over the commentary, opinions and conclusions people make based on my seemingly harmless and general commentary. This episode forced me to realize how difficult it is to rein in social conversation once a potentially harmful comment is posted, especially relating to a mutual friend or acquaintance.
This episode made me feel annoyed that I was not offered an option that would protect my patient's privacy. Also, I was frustrated that other people would not mind their own business and felt the obligation to spread the news, even though they had good intentions.
This episode made me realize that there are many ways to violate a patient's privacy without even knowing about it. Because of this, I have learned that it is better to just avoid talking about my patients on a social media website. This way, I completely reduce my chances of violating any privacy laws.
The episode made me feel uncomfortable with the options given to reply to friends responses. Both responses were completely inappropriate at any given time in the episode, but we had to choose one. We had little to no control over how much information was kept private.
I have realized thats its actually a lot easier than i imagined to get carried away and relay confidential patient information to people. When you get excited you could slip up on a social media site and talk about a patient, violating HIPAA. Its best just to not talk about patients in a public setting, especially online.
This episode made me feel out of control of the scenario at hand. I realized that it's very easy to make assumptions in certain situations and that even disclosing one small detail can be harmful to patients and their families.
Although everyone on this social media website seemed to know each other pretty well, it still made me feel awkward when they kept asking me personal questions about the patient. When they figured about the identity of the patient and Wendy figured out we had been talking about her dad, I felt like I felt bad because I just violated patient confidentiality.
Like my classmates, I began to feel uncomfortable as soon as my friends began asking more and more questions with no limits. They were relentless, and I didn't know how to stop them. The worst part of it all was when Wendy logged on and found out through a website that her father was in the hospital. That is personal information that she may have not wanted her friends to find out about and definitely would not want posted permanently on a website. I was disquieted by this, and she must have been too.
This episode made me feel a lack of control as I was forced to disclose the patient details despite me knowing that this is an obvious violation of policy. I also felt a bit panicked as people began to infer who the patient was, what was wrong with him, and offered their prayers as the situation progressed incredibly quickly and people did not stop talking even after I had asked them to.
At first, I was fine with discussing a vague aspect of my day relating to the patient, but once more information was shared and my friends started speculating and discussing the issue more, I became distressed. I wondered why I did not have the opportunity to stop the discussion earlier.  I actually became exasperated and upset that an increasing amount of patient information was being divulged and that my friends would not stop discussing the matter. I was fully aware of the fact that this was unacceptable behavior on a social network since patient information became more specific.
Needless to say the two choices given for each scenario were very limiting and disclosed too much information. I was upset that the character was even informing a friend group of such sensitive information so readily. The scenario demonstrated the reality of the power we as physicians are given, and the repercussions of disparaging the privacy guaranteed to patients.
This episode somewhat surprised me, regarding how forward my online peers were about wanting to find out information. Although they did not have wrongful intentions, their nature was to ask more questions. The questions were casual, but the concept of breaching patient confidentiality is very serious, and this was an uncomfortable situation for me. It was upsetting when Wendy logged on and found out her father was in the hospital and made me feel guilty and helpless.
This episode allowed me to experience the repercussions of violating professional standards online. The patient confidentiality breaches made me feel uncomfortable because it demonstrated how easily information can be compromised on social media. I have learned that it is important to protect the patient�s interests in every setting outside of the clinic and that I have an obligation to ensure that the patient�s privacy is not infringed upon.
This scenario made me feel helpless at the rate with which the situation got out of control.  The options provided were structured to provide too much information regardless of the context they attempted to shape.  The ability to prematurely end the conservation given the importance of the divulged information would have been appreciated.
I definitely felt a little guilty, if I were to put myself in the character's shoes. I provided too much information, and now it's my fault that the patient's daughter was completely blindsided, and that her entire social group knows. I also felt frustrated, because I couldn't stop the group from spiraling out of control with the given information. Again, it just shows how small facts built on each other to lead to such an out-of-control situation.

Basically do NOT talk about business online.
Professional online behavior is what every healthcare professional should exercise. They should respect the privilege of being able to interact and help patients, which often leads to learning about their personal lives, families, and medical status. They entrust us with this information and that privacy should be respected. Whenever online, always be cognizant of what your posting and make sure that it doesn't reveal any of that information.
Electronic professionalism is extremely important and relevant. It�s important to look through content with a critical lens before posting it on Facebook, twitter, and other places where others can easily see it. Because we want people to maintain trust in the medical profession, we must limit the amount of personal information we make available about ourselves. I realize that I may view something as normal whereas other people may deem it inappropriate. In any case, posting anything that discloses personal opinions or experiences (whether or not they pertain specifically to your work environment) has the potential to cause damage. A patient, employer, student, or fellow healthcare professional can happen across your material on the Internet and believe you are behaving unprofessionally.
I believe electronic professionalism to be one of the most important aspects in a physician's life, especially in this day and age of technology. As stated in my initial post on question 1, when it comes to one's job in this profession, it is best not to post ANYTHING pertaining to particular patients. If one decides to discuss an experience that happened to them as a provider, they must not divulge any information that compromises the patient. In addition to patient-related offenses, the physician must present themselves in a professional manner. For example, the doctor should not post pictures or statuses of them drinking or participating in any illegal activities or drugs. Electronic professionalism, to me, means holding oneself to be a professional online in all realms.
I think professional online behavior has many components:1. Always post things that you would feel comfortable saying in front of your boss, coworkers, etc. This would include obviously staying clear from making derogatory statements about patients (or commenting on patients at all, for that matter). Also, I would try to stay away from commenting on politically and socially controversial things just for the sake of maintaining your professional image. 2. In general, professional online behavior, in my opinion, would simply mean not really discussing work at all. Any discussion of work can lead down a path of trouble (as we saw in this episode). 3. Making sure all photos are professional. Photos of yourself doing anything illegal is obviously unacceptable on a multitude of levels, but also photos should generally remain "G" rated!
As much as we would like to separate our personal lives from our professional lives, I believe that with social media, it is more of a decision between separating our private lives from our public lives. Therefore, I agree with Shivani and believe that the safest professional online behavior would be to refrain from commenting about anything that relates to patient history because you never know when someone may recognize the patient you are speaking of. In addition, although I believe that professionals should be able to express their opinions, I believe that professionals should not post anything that may be considered rude language or offensive content because it may harm their public image or ability to obtain a job. As a counter argument, I can see that the quality of care physicians provide is more important than their public image, but as of now, it seems that society continues to hold physicians to high standards regardless of whether it relates to the actual care patients receive. Along the same train of thought, I found a study that concluded that although many medical schools use social media, not many of their policies do not include a definition of appropriate social media conduct for their students. Therefore, a standardized definition for professional online behavior has not been established. I believe that although students should know what and what not to post on social media, it may be helpful to have a universal set of guidelines as well. I also came across a study that researched whether it was appropriate for healthcare providers to search up their patients on social media sites, and although only 10% of faculty and students admitted to actually conducting a search, about 78% in total believed that conducting a search is not an invasion of privacy. Even though it is true that social media is public, I believe that searching up patients on social media should generally not be considered appropriate professional behavior.
Professional online behavior is keeping to HIPAA and not revealing any patient information to the public. Professional online behavior is crucial to any health care worker. As a professional and someone who is entrusted with the privacy of many patients, health care workers should be careful about what they post online and make sure that even under pressure they do not breach the privacy of the patient.
Online professional behavior must be carefully monitored in order to protect both the medical professional and the patient. If at anytime possible, professionals should avoid posting anything work related to their online social media. They should be sure to avoid violating the privacy or personal information of those they work around and be courteous to those online. Professional online behavior should match behavior of those in the workplace.
I think professional online behavior is simply exercising awareness and control when posting anything online, because nothing that is posted or sent is ever truly private or protected.
Professional online behavior is not only not posting information about patients and strictly following HIPPA, but maintaining a good professional image. Private information from patients should never be revealed. It is always better to be safe than sorry and remember that medical information is meant to stay off of social media. Also, all pictures or statuses you post or are tagged in should be professional. Being in the medical field is a 24/7 commitment, and I think that the way you portray yourself in the hospital should carry over to social media as well.
Professional online behavior is displaying appropriate items on the web. Professional online behavior includes following HIPAA regulations and posting information that displays the individual in a positive manner.
I believe that professional online behavior would be to avoid sharing any private health information or any other such details which could possibly harm another individual. Also, being professional would imply representing oneself in an appropriate manner so that an image of respect, integrity, and discipline are conveyed. As a professional in the field of healthcare, the individual represents the institution to which they belong and their actions reflect upon the institution as a whole. Therefore it is essential to maintain a level of professionalism at all times whether in the workplace or in an online discussion. Most importantly, healthcare professionals must adhere strictly to the rules and regulations presented through the HIPAA legislation since this dictates the necessary actions for maintaining patient privacy.
Professional online behavior is a difficult concept. On one hand, professionals deserve to speak to their friends in the same manner as any other person: jokingly, comfortably, or with abandon. Unfortunately, the price of professionalism is heightened responsibility. There is a responsibility to patients that cannot be violated and precludes the professional's want to have fun. The safest way to maintain a professional online presence is silly not to talk about your career.
While electronic forums are different from real life, the concepts of professional behavior still apply. Physicians are generally expected to put their patients best interest first. This includes maintaining patient confidentiality (HIPPA), which didn't happen in this simulation. Professional online behavior also includes conducting oneself in a manner that promotes trust between patient and the medical field. This includes maintaining a professional image, like we try to do in person through our clothes, our speech and our general demeanor.
In short, professional online behavior is respecting your own self-image as well as those of the patients you care for. It is important for you to maintain a good image of yourself online. As taught in this episode, we must be very very careful when discussing patients online. Being mindful of how much detail we disclose and to whom we disclose the information are extremely important. In deciding the limit of information to share, we must not reveal the identity of the patient in order to honor, respect, and uphold the privacy that patient should receive. With the recent popularity of mass media websites such as Facebook, it is important to realize how quickly and broadly things can spread in a matter of minutes. Patients entrust their health and lives to doctors because they respect, admire, and hold them to a higher standard. Physicians must uphold that through their behavior on an off the social media.
I think online professional behavior  should reflect real-life professional behavior. This it is important the type of language/content that you use in your statuses or pictures. Moreover, pictures should not reveal any obscene behavior. A good motto is to not post/post pictures of anything you would not be willing to show to your boss. Professional online behavior  can play a large role in an individuals judgement of you. You could be the best doctor in the nation but If you post very bad statuses and dirty  photos, a patient may judge you as unfit to diagonse/operate on him/her.
Professional online behavior as covered in our modules should be conducted over secure connections, with professional work email addresses and no personal/casual references. This is to protect a patient's information from the public and to protect our own information. After going online on a public computer, it's essential to ensure one is not still logged into websites/systems and deleting history of searches (what if someone could identify your patient by the searches you did?). Many physicians may choose to bring work home and/or discuss prognosis with other physicians on the same case. Professional online behavior would be to use secure methods of online communication, or use other methods such as talking on the phone. Patient information should be protected everywhere, so when working online as a professional, discretion should be used even amongst family. Regarding behavior on social media, professional online behavior should be very distinct from personal/casual interactions seen amongst friends. It should reflect how we want our peers in medicine and other job professions to see us as mature, responsible adults.  I agree with Alice that there should be a partition between our personal and professional lives, and this should be reflected in online behavior. We cannot physically divide ourselves, but we can try our best to keep to divide personal and professional behavior. It may be tempting to talk about something that excited you or something rare with a patient, but doing so gives the potential to cause harm. As future physicians our responsibilities to protecting patients does not leave us when we leave the hospital for the day- it follows us home.
The respect that the population gives to the medical profession gives everyone in the field creates an obligation to maintain professionalism, especially because of the sensitive and personal nature of the things that people show us. Patients trust their doctors with things they don�t even tell their close family and friends, and that is why laws like HIPAA are in place. Even if such laws were not in place, I believe that it is the duty of doctors to protect their patients and part of this is acting conscientiously in all public areas, including the internet. Even if a post has no inappropriate patient information, but shows the doctor in an awkward social situation, such as a state of intoxication, it can lead to a loss of trust in a patient. Just imagine � would you want a person who was out drinking the night before to be doing surgery on you in the morning? In addition to violating trust, inappropriate posting has the potential to lead to a board investigation, and possible termination from their post. Although we are talking mostly about physicians, rules about professional behavior apply to all professions. One report states that one in 10 young people have been rejected from a job because of postings in their social media. There�s even a site called FireMe! that gathers tweets that display workers� showing bad attitudes about their jobs. I think that being on the internet creates a disconnect between you and your actions because you are just typing or putting a video into the vast unknown. There is no physical contact with other people so you cannot judge their reactions or predict their actions. Because of this, it is important to hold yourself to a high standard when online.
Professional online behavior, in my opinion, entails having the knowledge to know what to and what not to discuss on a social media website. It requires medical professionals to behave as such on all online platforms and be aware of all the information that they share and whether it is appropriate. As we discussed during the last summer session during the ethics sessions and otherwise, there are certain rules that have to be followed when dealing with social platforms regardless of whether it be online, at home, or in a public place. Online behavior is particularly important because once something has been posted on the Internet, there is no way to take it back. Deleting a comment, post, or a picture etc. may temporarily remove it, but does not guarantee that no one has seen it or has copied it. Additionally, it is equally inappropriate to participate in a conversation about patients, as it is to initiate such a conversation (knowingly or unknowingly). As a medical professional, it is imperative that we keep the importance of patient confidentiality in mind even out of the workplace. To me, this is the most important aspect of professional online behavior, and is a rule that I follow now and will do so in the future as well.
While playing through this episode, it became abundantly clear that it�s very hard to completely separate what we do in our professions and what we do in our private lives. I believe in everyone�s right to privacy, including a physician�s, but I also believe that a physician should be held more accountable to what they do in social media sites. A physician who posts information about one of their patients online is not only breaching the trust of the patient, but they are also eroding the patient�s trust in the hospital system as well. In the medical professions, trust is key in providing adequate treatment for a patient. Interestingly, a quick Google search showed me that every case of a nurse or physician being dismissed because of social media wrongdoings was confidentiality-related. However, I don�t believe that this is the only harm that can come out of improper social media usage, since there is also the issue of rapport. It�s pretty obvious that a physician needs to build rapport with a patient, since the subject matter being discussed � the patient�s health � is always an extremely personal one, and that rapport will no doubt erode as well if the physician breaches confidentiality or is unprofessional. Sure, your social media site might be set to private, or to friends-only, but there are still people that will see what you post, who will know that you are a physician, and who will make judgments about your professionalism based on your posts. That being said, while I personally believe it�s perfectly okay to be more relaxed on social media sites, it�s still imperative to not appear rude or inappropriate in what you say. The truth of the matter is, society just has higher expectations for the professionalism and public image of physicians, and that this is something to keep in mind throughout all aspects of one�s public life. And yes, social media does count as public life.
As we have progressed through the twenty-first century online media has become increasingly popular with the general public and is a way to build connections and relationships. However, with increasing use of online media, comes increasing risk of misconduct. Professional behavior online has, therefore, become a central tenant to maintaining patient privacy and avoiding HIPAA violations. To ensure professional online behavior one must take appropriate steps to implement privacy policies to keep a professional appearance online.This includes keeping only sensible contents on one's page and removing anything that could represent oneself in a bad light. A good way to determine if performance is professional is determining if you would show the contents to your boss or mother. For example, posting a picture with alcohol in it could be considered unprofessional because it reflects badly on one's profession and could make people question one's judgement. This case was brought to our classes attention last year in the book, The Brewsters, where the main character got in trouble with the dean of his school for being in a social media post containing alcohol. Another example is one we are constantly reminded of in class, and it is to not post information about patients one has seen. It is important to ensure patient confidentiality by refraining from posting information concerning a patients medical history or personal life, even if it does not include their name. To maintain professional behavior it is best to not post any information about patients because one could easily make a mistake and reveal too much information. Another important part of patient confidentiality is not to express ill feelings towards one's job, coworkers, or patients. It can also be important to realize that what an employee posts on social media reflect not only on where they work, but also their own profession.
I think that professional online behavior is an extension of professional hospital/clinic behavior. Things that you know you should not say or do in the hospital are the same things that you should not discuss online. The seeming anonymity of the internet makes it easy to get carried away and post things that disrespect the patient's privacy. As a result, professional online behavior should be closely scrutinized to avoid breaches in patient privacy. In general, I think it would be best to avoid posting any patient information online (unless it is part of research that has been published online with the patient's consent) since it is permanent and security is not guaranteed.
I don't think being online really affects professional behavior. Understanding how to act professionally, following all guidelines of HIPAA or other contracts that are agreed to, cannot be breached just because you aren't wearing a white coat when you post online. I see it a lot in people I know from high school, but I don't think people understand that the information and pictures they post online never fully leave. There are way too many situations of people not getting a job at the company they want because they have pictures of underage drinking or another unprofessional behavior on their social media page. I think professional behavior doesn't change between online and in person. If you wouldn't want your boss to see what you are posting then don't post it.
Part of professional online behavior means keeping work apart from social media.  What happens at work needs to be kept confidential, and no details about work should show up on social media.  Details about a patient, including information that seems harmless, cannot be revealed online.
Professional online behavior is upholding HIPPA regulations as well as your workplace behavior. It is knowing what is and is not appropriate to share with the general public, because nothing is really private on the internet. This includes not sharing any patient information or inappropriate comments about coworkers, patients, or any institution.
Professional online behavior is maintaining a social media presence that is solid in legal terms, abides by the professional contracts and culture of whatever institution you happen to work at, and is generally socially acceptable. Since your personal and professional lives are not two completely separate things, and they DO intertwine, it is important to keep in mind that anything you put out in the internet is also a reflection of your company and you as a professional. Following these simple guidelines, along with a pinch of common sense, will ensure professional online behavior.
Presenting oneself online in the same manner as that in the clinic will prevent inappropriate breaches of the physician-patient relationship. As a future physician, I understand I also act as the face of medicine for my patients, so I should place effort into exceeding the expectations that patients hold of me.
Professional online behavior is not breaching patient privacy (upholding HIPAA, as Emily stated below) and conducting oneself in an appropriate manner online. It is important to remember that although we prefer to keep our work and social spheres separate, there are times in which they do overlap, and it is important to conduct oneself professionally.
Professional online behavior means being able to understand what information is appropriate to share within a social media format. As we have learned about online professionalism during our time in this program, the best rule we have learned is to not put anything online that you would not want a future patient to see. Professional online behavior is about realizing all of the implications a simple post may have before it is put online. In this episode, the physician did not realize this beforehand, which caused everyone else to realize the identity of the patient being discussed, which culminated in a severe violation of patient confidentiality.
Online professionalism encompasses maintaining a standard of professional behavior while conducting yourself on social media. This behavior arises from the judgment in knowing the distinction between the appropriate and inappropriate things to express on social media. Individuals working in the health care field should especially be cautious in expressing something on social media as it can have significant implications that the user might not be aware of. Many people may not consider the potential impact of their online content on their patients and the public. Thus, even a momentary lapse in judgment by an individual to post something inappropriate could reflect poorly on the entire medical profession. Hence, online professionalism involves a precautionary approach, in which the medical professional acts prudently in deciding whether or not he or she should post certain content on social media. Medical professionals should acknowledge and respect the relationship they have with their patients, which is essentially based on mutual trust in regards to privacy and confidentiality of their information. Also, they should not post things that are disrespectful to colleagues or patients and their families. Although social media does bring about the perception of anonymity and detachment, medical professionals must always consider the ramifications of their actions.
I agree with all of the comments below.  Professional online behavior entails maintaining a refined and respectful online profile at all times.  In addition to always protecting patient confidentiality, medical professionals must also present themselves as intelligent, open-minded, culturally competent, and empathetic individuals.  This can be accomplished by: publishing/writing content that one would feel comfortable sharing with his/her superior; using appropriate and grammatically correct language; avoiding emotionally, politically, or religiously charged opinions; and maintaining a respectful tone towards all people.  Medical professionals are held to higher standards and we must remember that we represent the medical field at all times.
Professional online behavior is similar to that of professional behavior in person. The reason it is a major issue is due to the fact that an individual is behind a computer and does not have to immediately deal with the consequences of his/her actions. An individual can easily disclose confidential information online without noticing and can also act in a manner that is not acceptable in any scenario.
Professional online behavior includes not only withholding information about your patients and work (HIPAA guidelines) but also portraying yourself in a professional manner. For example, if a patient happened to look up your social media profile and it made you seem like a party animal, or someone who participated in the consumption of illegal substances or frequent drinking, or even if it showed excessive use of vulgar/inappropriate language it would make them feel less comfortable with handing over their health in your hands. You need to portray yourself, and your institution in a manner that coincides with how you would want your patient or superior to see you because everything online is permanent and visible for everyone to see.
Professional behavior does not change depending on if there are actual face to face interactions or cyberspace interactions. As a physician, we must always at all times remain courteous, disciplined and respectful of our jobs and our patients. We must always remember the importance and delicacy of the nature of our jobs, as we are literally dealing with people's lives. When we are online, our language, the subject matter of our conversations, and our attitude/tone should reflect the respect and honor of our jobs.
Professional online behavior should be no different from physical professional behavior because it leaves the same impact on colleagues and patients who may come across your online persona. It is very easy to disclose confidential information online, but it is important to understand how permanent and potentially viral the information you post online is. We need to present ourselves with dignity and class online as well as in person and not post anything that may be degrading to us personally or medicine as a profession.
Do not discuss anything related to your profession online
Professional online behavior is the same as, if not, more stringent than clinical professionalism. The comments that are posted are documented, public, and permanent, as are the comments of colleagues and bystanders. The relationship between a patient and physician is to be protected, private and patient directed. Anything related to the work place whether on social media or in face-to-face interaction demands confidentiality, respect, and care.
It's follows the same guidelines as professionalism in the physical world. The difference is that the online world allows a much greater degree of public access to your activity and what you say, so whatever you release online will likely affect more people that it would in the strictly physical world
Professional online behavior is respecting one's patients and their right to privacy. It is better to not discuss patient information on social media, because it can be accessed by people who are not authorized to have patient information. In a healthcare setting where sending patient information is vital for their care, it is necessary to send information in a secure and trusted manner.
Professional online behavior has the same core values as any other sort of professionalism in the real world. Information about patients should never be posted online. People in a profession should also keep their social media pages free of any unprofessional or suggestive pictures and posts.
Professional online behavior is knowing the boundary between professional relations and personal relations. It also means maintaining full disclosure when conversations turn to discussing work and patients. Furthermore, keeping your online behavior, especially social media behavior, private from patients is also important. The boundary between professional and personal online behavior should be maintained.
Maintaining professionalism is a very important hallmark of medicine. You should always distinguish between work and your personal life on social media. If you must post something about your work on social media, you should create a separate account to do so. Also, you should never disclose patient information online through any means.
The theme of professional online behavior is separation of work and social media. What happens at work stays at work. What is said between the patient and physician stays between the patient and physician. Any details or information about patients should NEVER be revealed online, no matter how minor they may seem. Honestly, it is best to keep work life off the internet, but if something needs to be posted, it should be done from a completely separate account dedicated to work-related topics only.
Professional online behavior has the same applications as professionalism in daily life, that is you are responsible for anything you say or do. Online professionalism has the additional aspect of being more widely accessible both in who can see your online profiles as well as the length of time for which they can access it; therefore, professional online behavior should be even more certain in terms of appropriateness, respectfulness, and confidentiality.
Appropriate professional conduct online (including social networking sites) includes portraying oneself in a professional manner at all times (i.e. no inappropriate, illegal, or potentially embarrassing conduct). In essence, it is prudent not to portray oneself in a manner or situation that you would not want a patient, authority figure or family member to see. In addition, it is important to consider the privacy of patients. Professional online behavior also includes not disclosing patient information as per HIPPA laws and out of respect for the patient.
Professional online behavior necessitates a thorough awareness of one's identity on the internet. This includes being cognizant of the websites and postings one has contributed to or taken part in. Additionally, one should beware of any illegal or inconsiderate pictures or posts. Maintaining privacy with regards to personal or professional matters is integral. One should perpetually consider how he or she is portrayed to fellow professional or potential employers.
Professional online behavior is not giving out any details about a patient or a case, including name, age, illness, symptoms, family, friends, career, life events, and any other identifying factors. Although a side comment about a patient may seem harmless, any small detail could be traced back to reveal a patient's identity; therefore, professionals should avoid discussing patients/cases at all. If patient information must be revealed online to someone authorized to receive it, it should be done cautiously and via a password-protected or encrypted method.
I think that professional online behavior pertains to maintaining confidentiality and above all protecting the patient�s interests. In order to ensure that this is maintained, health/work related information should not be revealed on any form of social media. Furthermore, individuals should present themselves in a manner that will not compromise the integrity and credibility of their professions.
Professional online behavior requires a bit more self-awareness than general professional behavior. It requires shielding one's private life from social networks or other online resources. Any inappropriate behavior online can affect one's reputation, both online and in real life, so online behavior must be carefully moderated. One should understand how quickly information online can disseminate, and therefore one should keep a tight handle on the kind of information he or she posts online.
Professional online behavior necessitates a decorum that is decidedly distinct from professional behavior in any other setting.  Maintaining a separate work life from a private life can be difficult, but it is absolutely necessary in the medical profession to ensure that even the most simple facts divulged can lead to a determination of a patient's identity.  A comprehensive awareness of one's position and responsibility is vital.
